Despite widely documented advancements in phenology with warming climate, we lack empirical estimates of how selection on phenology varies in response to continuous climate drivers or how phenological shifts in response to warming conditions affect fitness. We leverage an unusual long-term dataset with repeated, individual measurements of phenology and reproduction in a long-lived alpine plant. We analyze phenotypic plasticity in flowering phenology in relation to two climate drivers, snowmelt timing and growing degree days (GDDs). Plants flower earlier with increased GDDs and earlier snowmelt, and directional selection also favors earlier flowering under these conditions. However, reproduction still declines with warming and early snowmelt, even when flowering is early. Furthermore, the steepness of this reproductive decline increases dramatically with warming conditions, resulting in very little fruit production regardless of flowering time once GDDs exceed approximately 225 degree days or snowmelt occurs before May 15. Even though advancing phenology confers a fitness advantage relative to stasis, these shifts are insufficient to maintain reproduction under warming, highlighting limits to the potential benefits of phenological plasticity under climate change.",01/05/2024,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A three-year reciprocal translocation experiment was performed along an elevation gradient from 3200 m to 3800 m in the Tibetan Plateau for six alpine plants. Transplanting to lower elevation (warming) advanced the first flowering date (FFD) and transplanting to higher elevation (cooling) had the opposite effect. The FFD of early spring flowering plants (ESF) was four times less sensitive to warming than to cooling (by -2.1 d/degrees C and 8.4 d/degrees C, respectively), while midsummer flowering plants (MSF) were about twice as sensitive to warming than to cooling (-8.0 d/degrees C and 4.9 d/degrees C, respectively). Compared with pooled warming and cooling data, warming alone significantly underpredicted 3.1 d/degrees C for ESF and overestimated 1.7 d/degrees C for MSF. These results suggest that future empirical and experimental studies should consider nonlinear temperature responses that can cause such warming-cooling asymmetries as well as differing life strategies (ESF vs. MSF) among plant species.",2014-12,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies have observed community phenological sequences in the field. Here we explore the changes in timing and duration of the community phenological sequence (i.e. onset of leaf-out (OLO), first flower bud (FB), first flowering (FF), first fruiting-set (FFS), post-fruiting vegetation (OPFV), first leaf-coloring (FLC) and complete leaf-coloring (CLC)) along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 3800 m in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau. Our results indicate that OLO and FFS significantly advanced and other timings of phenological events significantly delayed at 3200 m compared with higher elevations (3600 and 3800 m). The flowering duration of the community was shortest and other phenological durations (except budding stage and post-fruiting vegetation stage) were longest at 3200 m. The duration of the growing season decreased as elevation increased, and the ratio of the durations of the reproductive period and growing season was smallest at 3200 m. There were negative correlations between the proportion of early-spring flowering functional group plants and FB, and the durations of leafing and post-fruiting vegetation of the community. Positive correlations were found between the proportion of mid-summer flowering functional group plants in the community and these variables. There were significant negative correlations between flowering duration of the community and annual mean air temperature and soil moisture. Therefore, our results suggest that different community compositions might respond differently to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Responses may occur by range shifts, phenological adjustments in growth and reproduction, or both. Here, we compare distribution and phenology of 83 arctic and boreal mountain species, sampled identically in the early 20th (1917-1919) and 21st centuries (2017-2018) from a region of northern Sweden that has warmed significantly. We test two compensatory hypotheses to high-latitude warming-upward shifts in distribution, and earlier or extended growth and reproduction. For distribution, we show dramatic upward migration by 69% of species, averaging 6.1 m per decade, especially boreal woodland taxa whose upward expansion has reduced arctic montane habitat by 30%. Twenty percent of summit species showed distributional shifts but downward, especially moisture-associated snowbed flora. For phenology, we detected wide inter-annual variability in the onset of leafing and flowering in both eras. However, there was no detectable change in growing-season length, relating to two mechanisms. First, plot-level snow melt data starting in 1917 demonstrated that melt date, rather than vernal temperatures, better predicts plant emergence, with snow melt influenced by warmer years having greater snowfall-warmer springs did not always result in earlier emergence because snowbeds can persist longer. Second, the onset of reproductive senescence between eras was similar, even when plant emergence was earlier by a month, possibly due to intensified summer heat stress or hard-wired `canalization' where senescence occurs regardless of summer temperature. Migrations in this system have possibly buffered arctic species against displacement by boreal expansion and warming, but ongoing temperature increases, woody plant invasion, and a potential lack of flexibility in timing of senescence may foreshadow challenges.",2021-10,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of temperature change is especially high in the Arctic, but this is also where we have relatively little data on phenological changes and the processes driving these changes. In order to understand how Arctic plant species are likely to respond to future changes in climate, we monitored flowering phenology in response to both experimental and ambient warming for four widespread species in two habitat types over 21years. We additionally used long-term environmental records to disentangle the effects of temperature increase and changes in snowmelt date on phenological patterns. While flowering occurred earlier in response to experimental warming, plants in unmanipulated plots showed no change or a delay in flowering over the 21-year period, despite more than 1 degrees C of ambient warming during that time. This counterintuitive result was likely due to significantly delayed snowmelt over the study period (0.05-0.2days/yr) due to increased winter snowfall. The timing of snowmelt was a strong driver of flowering phenology for all species - especially for early-flowering species - while spring temperature was significantly related to flowering time only for later-flowering species. Despite significantly delayed flowering phenology, the timing of seed maturation showed no significant change over time, suggesting that warmer temperatures may promote more rapid seed development. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the specific environmental cues that drive species' phenological responses as well as the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation when forecasting phenology over the coming decades. As demonstrated here, the effects of altered snowmelt patterns can counter the effects of warmer temperatures, even to the point of generating phenological responses opposite to those predicted by warming alone.",2015-12,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flowering and fruiting phenology of plants is sensitive to environmental cues, and changes in reproductive phenology of individual plant species under climate change have been widely reported. However, how species-level phenological responses scale up to affect community-level reproductive phenology patterns (synchrony and reproductive duration) are still unclear.2. An experiment on the effects of nitrogen (N) addition and precipitation changes on reproductive phenological traits of 52 species was conducted in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau to determine the influence of the phenological response in different functional groups on community-level reproductive phenology.3. N addition significantly delayed the onset date of reproductive phenology of sedges (early-flowering species) and advanced the end date of reproduction of forbs (late-flowering species). Meanwhile, N addition reduced the number of individuals involved in reproduction of sedges and forbs, but it increased that of grasses (late-flowering species). Furthermore, N addition increased reproductive synchrony, delayed the onset and shortened the duration of reproductive phenology at the community level. However, precipitation changes and their interaction with N addition had no significant effect on reproductive phenology of the alpine plant community.4. Synthesis. These results suggested that differences in the direction and magnitude of response of different species to N enrichment lead to compression of reproductive duration at the community level, increasing the degree of overlap between reproductive events, which could change future species diversity, trophic interactions and productivity accumulation in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau.

To clarify flowering phenological changes, we collected 1646 ground-observed phenological records of 21 species, from 27 stations, for 78 time series, and daily average air temperature data from 1983 to 2017 on the QTP. Trends in the first flowering date (FFD) and changes with temperature increase were analyzed using regression models. The FFD of early flowering time series showed an overall trend for significant advance (-0.371 +/- 0.149 days/year, p < 0.001), whereas the mid-to-late-flowering showed a delayed trend (0.158 +/- 0.193 days/year, p = 0.108). This finding is in contrast with the stable trend for early flowering species and the advanced trend for midsummer and late-flowering species in high latitude and Arctic regions, where the low-temperature environment is similar. The growing degree days from 1 January to the day of the observed occurrence of the FFD for early flowering time series kept stable (p = 0.531) and FFD showed a positive regression with chilling days; however, the growing degree days of mid-to-late-flowering time series increased significantly at a rate of 5.375 +/- 2.519 degrees C-days/year (p < 0.001), indicating the limitation on FFD from other related climatic factors except for forcing temperature may strengthen, and FFD showed no relationship with chilling days. The mid-tolate-flowering time series showed vernalization sensitivity in the spring of the flowering year, whereas the early flowering time series did not. This indicated that retarded vernalization completion may be responsible for the delayed flowering phenology of mid-to-late-flowering species. The FFD of early flowering species, with flower preformation in the preceding autumn, was mainly controlled by forcing temperature in spring; decreased chilling days indicating warmer winter were also beneficial for development and fitness of preformed floral organs, and thus, temperature increase significantly advanced the FFD. These findings suggest that divergent flowering phenology shifts may alter the species composition and ecosystem services of alpine ecosystems, causing challenges in grassland management.",15/09/2021,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in flowering time and duration in plant communities are likely to influence plant-pollinator interactions. However, the effects of global warming on community-scale phenology have scarcely been studied in alpine ecosystems. I analyzed the flowering records of fellfield and snowbed communities collected over a nine-year period in the Taisetau Mountains of northern Japan. The flowering structure of alpine communities is composed of a flowering sequence of early-blooming fellfield species (FE), late-blooming fellfield species (FL), and snowbed species. Flowering initiation in FE showed small interannual variation, while peak flowering time was accelerated according to warmer temperature. Both the initiation and peak flowering time of FL depended on heat sum during early summer. The flowering period of fellfield communities was shortened under warmer conditions, and 1 degrees C warming thought to shorten the major flowering period by 3.8 days. The flowering initiation of snowbed plants strongly depended on snowmelt time, and the peak flowering time further advanced in warmer summers. However, the major flowering period of snowbed communities was independent of snowmelt time and thermal conditions because many snowbed species shifted flowering onset days with little changes in flowering period. As a result, the total flowering period of alpine plant communities was largely determined by snowmelt time, independent of thermal conditions. It is predicted that a 10-day earlier snowmelt will shorten the total flowering season by 4.8 days and a 10-day later snowmelt will extend the total flowering season by 5.8 days. Therefore, snowmelt regime is a major determinant factor of the flowering structure of alpine ecosystems.

In alpine ecosystems, where snowmelt timing is a key driver of phenology, earlier snowmelt may generate shifts in plant and pollinator phenology that vary across the landscape, potentially disrupting interactions. Here we ask how experimental advancement of snowmelt timing in a topographically heterogeneous alpine-subalpine landscape impacts flowering, insect pollinator visitation, and pathways connecting key predictors of plant-pollinator interaction. Snowmelt was advanced by an average of 13.5 days in three sites via the application of black sand over snow in manipulated plots, which were paired with control plots. For each forb species, we documented flowering onset and counted flowers throughout the season. We also performed pollinator observations to measure visitation rates. The majority (79.3%) of flower visits were made by dipteran insects. We found that plants flowered earlier in advanced snowmelt plots, with the largest advances in later-flowering species, but flowering duration and visitation rate did not differ between advanced snowmelt and control plots. Using piecewise structural equation models, we assessed the interactive effects of topography on snowmelt timing, flowering phenology, floral abundance, and pollinator visitation. We found that these factors interacted to predict visitation rate in control plots. However, in plots with experimentally advanced snowmelt, none of these predictors explained a significant amount of variation in visitation rate, indicating that different predictors are needed to understand the processes that directly influence pollinator visitation to flowers under future climate conditions. Our findings demonstrate that climate change-induced early snowmelt may fundamentally disrupt the predictive relationships among abiotic and biotic drivers of plant-pollinator interactions in subalpine-alpine environments.",2024-10,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using open-top chambers, we experimentally manipulated both summer temperatures and winter and spring snow accumulations and temperatures independently in a blanket bog in subarctic Sweden, yielding six climate scenarios. We studied the effects of these scenarios on flowering phenology and flower production of Andromeda polifolia (woody evergreen) and Rubus chamaemorus (perennial herb) during 2 years. The second year of our study (2002) was characterized by unusually high spring and early summer temperatures. Our winter manipulations led to consistent increases in winter snow cover. As a result, average and minimum air and soil temperatures in the high snow cover treatments were higher than in the winter ambient treatments, whereas temperature fluctuations were smaller. Spring warming resulted in higher average, minimum, and maximum soil temperatures. Summer warming led to higher air and soil temperatures in mid-summer (June-July), but not in late summer (August-September). The unusually high temperatures in 2002 advanced the median flowering date by 2 weeks for both species in all treatments. Superimposed on this effect, we found that for both Andromeda and Rubus, all our climate treatments (except summer warming for Rubus) advanced flowering by 1-4 days. The total flower production of both species showed a more or less similar response: flower production in the warm year 2002 exceeded that in 2001 by far. However, in both species flower production was only stimulated by the spring-warming treatments. Our results show that the reproductive ecology of both species is very responsive to climate change but this response is very dependent on specific climate events, especially those that occur in winter and spring. This suggests that high-latitude climate change experiments should focus more on winter and spring events than has been the case so far.",2004-09,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the effects of an experimental increase in growing-season temperature on growth and reproduction are also examined. The reproductive success of Leontodon decreased strongly as the flowering season progressed, possibly as a result of increased climatic severity and increased extent of pollen and resource limitation on reproduction. Experimentally warmed plants produced significantly more and heavier seeds, and flowered more than 1 wk earlier than control plants, showing that temperature conditions influence both reproductive processes and flowering phenology.

Under climate change, snowmelt advances and the risk of summer droughts increases. Yet, photoperiodism may prevent alpine plants from benefiting from an earlier start of the growing season. To identify the drivers of flowering phenology in the seven main species of an alpine grassland, we experimentally shifted the snowmelt date through snow manipulations, and excluded precipitation during summer. With “time-to-event” models, we analysed the beginning of main flowering with respect to temperature sums, time after snowmelt, and calendar day (photoperiod). We identified two phenology types: four species tracking snowmelt dates directly or with a certain lag set by temperature sums, including the dominant sedge Carex curvula, Anthoxanthum alpinum Helictotrichon versicolor, and Trifolium alpinum, and three species tracking photoperiod: Geum montanum, Leontodon helveticus and Potentilla aurea. Photoperiodism did not act as daylength threshold but rather modulated the thermal sums at flowering. Hence, photoperiod delayed flowering after earlier snowmelt. The grass A. alpinum was the only one of seven species that clearly responded to drought by earlier and longer flowering. The remarkably high importance of snowmelt dates for both phenology types suggests an earlier onset of flowering in a warmer climate, particularly for non-photoperiod-sensitive species, with an increasing risk for freezing damages and potential disruptions of biotic interactions in the most frequent type of alpine grassland across the Alps.

Because flowering period of alpine plants varies highly depending on snowmelt conditions, the effects of phenological variation on fruit-set success may vary among local populations. I observed the relationship between flowering time and fruit-set success in four populations of a bee-pollinated dwarf shrub, Rhododendron aureum, located in fellfield and snowbed habitats in northern Japan, for 12 or 13 years over the 25 years from 1995 to 2019. Flowering of the fellfield populations usually occurred in June, and flowering of the snowbed populations commonly started after mid-July, although there was considerable yearly variation in actual flowering time within individual populations. Generally, the fruit-set rates of the fellfield populations were low, with large yearly fluctuations, whereas those of the snowbed populations were stable and high. There was a clear trend toward a decrease in fruit-set rates with earlier flowering in the fellfield populations due to pollen limitation and occasional frost damage. The risk of frost damage increased with earlier flowering in the fellfield habitat. These results indicate that the effects of climate change on fruit-set success of alpine plants are strongly site-specific and are greatest early in the growing season.",2021-04,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A long-term monitoring of snowmelt regimes in a Japanese alpine area revealed that the onset of the snowmelt season has been accelerated during the last 17 years in early snowmelt sites but that such a trend has not been detected in late snowmelt sites. This indicates that the global warming effect on the snowmelt pattern may be site-specific. The flowering phenology of fellfield plants in an exposed wind-blown habitat was consistent between an unusually warm year (1998) and a normal year (2001). In contrast, the flowering occurrence of snowbed plants varied greatly between the years depending on the snowmelt time. There was a large number of flowering species in the fellfield community from mid- to late to late June and from mid- to late July. The flowering peak of an early-melt snowbed plant community was in the middle of the flowering season and that of a late-melt snowbed community was in the early flowering season. These habitat-specific phenological patterns were consistent between 1998 and 2001. The effects of the variation in flowering timing on seed-set success were evaluated for an entomophilous snowbed herb, Peucedanum multivittatum, along the snowmelt gradient during a 5-year period. When flowering occurred prior to early August, mean temperature during the flowering season positively influenced the seed set. When flowering occurred later than early August, however, the plants enjoyed high seed-set success irrespective of temperature conditions if frost damage was absent. These observations are probably explained based on the availability of pollinators, which depends not only on ambient temperature but also on seasonal progress. These results suggest that the effects of climate change on biological interaction may vary depending on the specific habitat in the alpine ecosystem in which diverse snowmelt patterns create complicated seasonality for plants within a very localized area.",2006-01,Accept,No reason given,maybe,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In alpine regions the temperature rise has been especially pronounced and together with decreasing winter precipitation has led to earlier snowmelt. The close association between time of snowmelt and plant growth at high elevations makes climate change for alpine plants particularly threatening. Here we transplanted eleven congeneric pairs of high- and low-elevation herbaceous species to common gardens differing c. 800 m in elevation, and c. 4 degrees C in mean growing season temperature to test whether reproductive phenologies of high- and low-elevation plants differ in their respective responses to temperature. Results indicate that high-elevation plants were less plastic in response to transplantation than their low-elevation congeners as the onsets of phenophases on average shifted 7 days less than in low-elevation plants. Plasticity of phenophase durations was overall weaker than that of phenophase onsets, and slightly stronger in high-elevation species compared to low-elevation congeners. We suggest that weaker plasticity in the onsets of early stages of reproductive phenology of high-elevation plants is related to spring frost, which constitutes a strong selective agent against early loss of winter hardiness. Some of the plastic responses of both low- and high-elevation species might potentially be adaptive under predicted climate change. However, the observed plasticity can be largely explained as a passive response to temperature and not as the result of natural selection in heterogeneous environments. The strong temperature-sensitivity of low-elevation species might promote their upward range expansion, but only to a certain threshold after which it becomes limited by the short growing season.

However, empirical evidence linking specific aspects of plant flowering phenology to the number of flowers produced is limited, particularly under future global climate change. We used phenology measurements after 2, 3, 6, and 7 years of a fully factorial, climate change field experiment in an alpine meadow pasture on the central Tibetan Plateau to understand: 1) how experimental warming and snow addition affect the date of first and last flowering in related forb and shrub species, Potentilla saundersiana Royle and Potentilla fruticosa L.; and 2) how these changes in the timing of phenological events alter flowering duration and production, as a proxy for reproductive effort. We found that warming significantly advanced the date of first flowering in both P. fruticosa and P. saundersiana, with no other significant effects on flowering duration or production. In contrast to warming, simulated snowstorms delayed the date of first flowering in P. saundersiana, but had no significant effect on P. fruticosa. There were no significant treatment interactions. For both species, flower production increased as the last date of flowering occurred later. These results indicate that as climate change alters alpine plant phenology, advances in the timing of first flowering alone will not necessarily translate to increases in flowering duration and enhanced reproductive effort. Instead, these findings demonstrate the importance of the date of last flowering in mediating plant reproductive effort and success.",01/04/2020,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a 7-year field warming and altered precipitation experiment initiated in 2017, we measured three reproductive phenological events and seven reproductive traits of six dominant species, belonging to two flowering functional groups, to assess the effects of climate change on reproductive phenology and the reproductive consequence of changing the phenology in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau from 2021 to 2023. Warming significantly advanced the start of flowering in early-spring flowering (ESF) and mid-summer flowering (MSF) plants, while the fruiting period of ESF plants remained stable. Furthermore, warming led to a decrease in the number of seeds and productivity of alpine plants, while seed size remained stable. Phenological changes regulate the reproductive success of alpine plants. Specifically, the start of flowering for ESF plants and the start of fruiting for MSF plants regulated the number of seeds and productivity of the two flowering functional groups, respectively. The increase in phenological niche overlap and intensification of interspecific competition, caused by different phenological responses of the flowering functional groups to warming, also are key factors contributing to the decline in seed production of alpine plants. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that the reproductive success of alpine plants would be decreased by earlier reproduction under climate warming, and alpine plants tend to maintain stable seed size in response to climate change.

Concurrently, they risk the loss of reproductive efforts to late frosts. Quantifying long-term trends in northeastern alpine flower phenology and late-spring/early-summer frost risk is limited by a dearth of phenology and climate data, except for Mount Washington, New Hampshire (1916 m a.s.l.). Methods: Logistic phenology models for three northeastern US alpine species (Diapensia lapponica, Carex bigelowii and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) were developed from 4 yr (2008-2011) of phenology and air temperature measurements from 12 plots proximate to Mount Washington's long-term summit meteorological station. Plot-level air temperature, the logistic phenology models, and Mount Washington's climate data were used to hindcast model yearly (1935-2011) floral phenology and frost damage risk for the focal species. Key results: Day of year and air growing degree-days with threshold temperatures of -4 degrees C (D. lapponica and C. bigelowii) and -2 degrees C (V. vitis-idaea) best predicted flowering. Modeled historic flowering dates trended significantly earlier but the 77-yr change was small (1.2-2.1 d) and did not significantly increase early-flowering risk from late-spring/early-summer frost damage. Conclusions: Modeled trends in phenological advancement and sensitivity for three northeastern alpine species are less pronounced compared with lower elevations in the region, and this small shift in flower timing did not increase risk of frost damage. Potential reasons for limited earlier phenological advancement at higher elevations include a slower warming trend and increased cloud exposure with elevation and/or inadequate chilling requirements.",2014-09,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phenological shifts have also been reported in alpine environments, where short growing seasons and low temperatures make reproduction particularly challenging, requiring fine-tuning to environmental cues. However, it remains unclear if species from such habitats, with their specific adaptations, harbour the same potential for phenological plasticity as species from less demanding habitats. Methods Fourteen congeneric species pairs originating from mid and high elevation were reciprocally transplanted to common gardens at 1050 and 2000 m a.s.l. that mimic prospective climates and natural field conditions. A drought treatment was implemented to assess the combined effects of temperature and precipitation changes on the onset and duration of reproductive phenophases. A phenotypic plasticity index was calculated to evaluate if mid- and high-elevation species harbour the same potential for plasticity in reproductive phenology. Key Results Transplantations resulted in considerable shifts in reproductive phenology, with highly advanced initiation and shortened phenophases at the lower (and warmer) site for both mid- and high-elevation species. Drought stress amplified these responses and induced even further advances and shortening of phenophases, a response consistent with an `escape strategy'. The observed phenological shifts were generally smaller in number of days for high-elevation species and resulted in a smaller phenotypic plasticity index, relative to their mid-elevation congeners. Conclusions While mid- and high-elevation species seem to adequately shift their reproductive phenology to track ongoing climate changes, high-elevation species were less capable of doing so and appeared more genetically constrained to their specific adaptations to an extreme environment (i.e. a short, cold growing season).",2015-11,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Arctic, rapid phenological changes in many taxa are occurring in association with earlier snowmelt. The timing of snowmelt is jointly affected by the size of the late winter snowpack and the temperature during the spring thaw. Increased winter snowpack results in delayed snowmelt, whereas higher air temperatures and faster snowmelt advance the timing of snowmelt. Where interannual variation in snowpack is substantial, changes in the timing of snowmelt can be largely uncoupled from changes in air temperature. Using detailed, long-term data on the flowering phenology of four arctic plant species from Zackenberg, Greenland, we investigate whether there is a phenological component to the temperature conditions experienced prior to and during flowering. In particular, we assess the role of timing of flowering in determining pre-flowering exposure to freezing temperatures and to the temperatures experienced prior to flowering. We then examine the implications of flowering phenology for flower abundance. Earlier snowmelt resulted in greater exposure to freezing conditions, suggesting an increased potential for a mismatch between the timing of flowering and seasonal weather conditions and an increased potential for negative consequences, such as freezing damage. We also found a parabolic relationship between the timing of flowering and the temperature experienced during flowering after taking interannual temperature effects into account. If timing of flowering advances to a cooler period of the growing season, this may moderate the effects of a general warming trend across years. Flower abundance was quadratically associated with the timing of flowering, such that both early and late flowering led to lower flower abundance than did intermediate flowering. Our results indicate that shifting the timing of flowering affects the temperature experienced during flower development and flowering beyond that imposed by interannual variations in climate. We also found that phenological timing may affect flower abundance, and hence, fitness. These findings suggest that plant population responses to future climate change will be shaped not only by extrinsic climate forcing, but also by species' phenological responses.",2015-03,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, alpine plant species and ecosystems experience substantial changes due to prolonged phenological seasons, while the responses, mechanisms and implications remain widely unclear. In this 3-year study, we investigated the effects of advancing snowmelt on the phenology of alpine snowbed species. We related microclimatic drivers to species and ecosystem phenology using in situ monitoring and phenocams. We further used predictive modelling to determine whether early snowmelt sites could be used as sentinels for future conditions. Temperature during the snow-free period primarily influenced flowering phenology, followed by snowmelt timing. Salix herbacea and Gnaphalium supinum showed the most opportunistic phenology, while annual Euphrasia minima struggled to complete its phenology in short growing seasons. Phenological responses varied more between years than sites, indicating potential local long-term adaptations and suggesting these species' potential to track future earlier melting dates. Phenocams captured ecosystem-level phenology (start, peak and end of phenological season) but failed to explain species-level variance. Our findings highlight species-specific responses to advancing snowmelt, with snowbed species responding highly opportunistically to changes in snowmelt timings while following species-specific developmental programs. While species from surrounding grasslands may benefit from extended growing seasons, snowbed species may become outcompeted due to internal-clock-driven, non-opportunistic senescence, despite displaying a high level of phenological plasticity. Our study investigates the phenological responses of five typical snowbed species to advancing snowmelt using in situ monitoring, phenocam imagery and predictive modelling. Over 3 years, we found temperature to be the primary driver of phenological changes in alpine snowbeds, with varying importance of photoperiodism among species.

Phenological activities are among the most sensitive plant responses to climate change and have important effects at all levels within the ecosystem. We tested the effects of two experimental treatments, extended growing season via snow removal and extended growing season combined with soil warming, on plant phenology in tussock tundra in Alaska from 1995 through 2003. We specifically monitored the responses of eight species, representing four growth forms: (i) graminoids (Carex bigellowii and Eriophorum vaginatum); (ii) evergreen shrubs (Ledum palustre, Cassiope tetragona, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea); (iii) deciduous shrubs (Betula nana and Salix pulchra); and (iv) forbs (Polygonum bistorta). Our study answered three questions: (i) Do experimental treatments affect the timing of leaf bud break, flowering, and leaf senescence? (ii) Are responses to treatments species-specific and growth form-specific? and (iii) Which environmental factors best predict timing of phenophases? Treatment significantly affected the timing of all three phenophases, although the two experimental treatments did not differ from each other. While phenological events began earlier in the experimental plots relative to the controls, duration of phenophases did not increase. The evergreen shrub, Cassiope tetragona, did not respond to either experimental treatment. While the other species did respond to experimental treatments, the total active period for these species did not increase relative to the control. Air temperature was consistently the best predictor of phenology. Our results imply that some evergreen shrubs (i.e., C.tetragona) will not capitalize on earlier favorable growing conditions, putting them at a competitive disadvantage relative to phenotypically plastic deciduous shrubs.

Although a number of studies have addressed responses of plant phenology to warming and altered precipitation individually, their interactions can alter plant phenology differently than either does independently. To explore how the interactions between global change drivers alter alpine ecosystems, we conducted a factorial experiment manipulating warming (ambient and +2 degrees C) and altered precipitation (50% decrease, control, and 50% increase) simultaneously in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Over two years, we monitored plant phenological events, leafout day and first flowering day, for 11 common plant species that account for 74.4% of the total above biomass. Surprisingly, there was no interaction between warming and changes in precipitation on community plant phenology, but warming advanced leaf-out and first flowering day by 7.10 and 9.79 d, respectively. Unlike the community response, plant functional groups had a variety of direct and interactive responses to the experimental climate drivers. While the phenology of legumes was most influenced by temperature, temperature and precipitation interacted to alter the phenology of grasses and forbs. To explore how plant phenological sensitivity on the Tibetan Plateau is compared with other meadow ecosystems, we combined our dataset with a global plant phenology dataset. Interestingly, the phenological sensitivity of leaf-out day and first flowering day on the Tibetan Plateau is 7.3 and 37.8 times greater than global phenological sensitivity, respectively. This result highlights that a meta-analysis of global phenological sensitivity may significantly underestimate change in some regions-even regions as large as the Tibetan Plateau. Together, our results suggest that the Tibetan Plateau may experience rapid change as temperatures warm and that these changes will likely be more rapid than in other regions of the world. Further, our study highlights that if we are to make accurate predictions of how plant phenology may change with warming, we need to understand the specific environmental cues that drive phenological responses across different areas.",2019-01,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also show that early flowering species have demonstrated lower intraspecific variability in their response to climate cues in comparison with late flowering species, such that individual flowering times of early species are more closely tied to environmental predictors. Previous work has suggested that early flowering species are more variable in their phenology. However, these studies have mostly examined variation in phenology over time, whereas we examined variation in phenology over space. We suggest that both patterns can be explained by the tighter coupling between phenology and climate cues for early flowering species. Thus, early flowering species have low intraspecific variance in flowering times within a single growing season as individuals respond more uniformly to a common set of cues in comparison with late flowering species.

The timing of flowering and fruiting (phenology) is often temperature dependent and tends to advance as the climate warms. Herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations can provide historical phenology records and have been used, on a localised scale, to predict species' phenological sensitivity to climate change. Conducting similar localised studies in the Canadian Arctic, however, poses a challenge where the collection of herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations have been temporally and spatially sporadic. We used flowering and seed dispersal times of 23 Arctic species from herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations collected from across the 2.1million km(2) area of Nunavut, Canada, to determine (1) which monthly temperatures influence flowering and seed dispersal times; (2) species' phenological sensitivity to temperature; and (3) whether flowering or seed dispersal times have advanced over the past 120years. We tested this at different spatial scales and compared the sensitivity in different regions of Nunavut. Broadly speaking, this research serves as a proof of concept to assess whether phenology-climate change studies using historic data can be conducted at large spatial scales. Flowering times and seed dispersal time were most strongly correlated with June and July temperatures, respectively. Seed dispersal times have advanced at double the rate of flowering times over the past 120years, reflecting greater late-summer temperature rises in Nunavut. There is great diversity in the flowering time sensitivity to temperature of Arctic plant species, suggesting climate change implications for Arctic ecological communities, including altered community composition, competition, and pollinator interactions.

The experiment was run at one subarctic site and one alpine site for 2 years and 1 year, respectively, using open-top chambers (OTC). The 2-year temperature enhancement at the subarctic site had a marked effect on the flowering phenology. Cushions inside the OTC started flowering substantially earlier than control cushions. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs, and maturation of capsules occurred earlier. The cushions also responded positively in reproductive terms and produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio. After 1 year temperature enhancement at the alpine site there was a weak trend for earlier flowering, but there was no significant difference in seed production or seed/ovule ratio.",1997-12,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier snowmelt at high latitudes advances above-ground plant phenology, thereby affecting water, nutrient and carbon cycles. Despite the key role of fine roots in these ecosystem processes, phenological responses to earlier snowmelt have never been assessed below-ground. 2. We experimentally advanced snowmelt in two contrasting plant community types (heath and meadow) in northern Sweden and measured above- and below-ground phenology (leaf-out, flowering and fine root growth). We expected earlier snowmelt to advance both above- and below-ground phenology, and shrub-dominated heath to be more responsive than meadow. 3. Snow melted on average 9 days earlier in the manipulated plots than in controls, and soil temperatures were on average 0.9 degrees C higher during the snowmelt period of 3 weeks. This resulted in small advances in above-ground phenology, but contrary to our expectations, root phenology was unresponsive, with root growth generally starting before leaf-out. These responses to the snowmelt treatment were similar in both plant community types, despite strong differences in dominating plant functional types and root properties, such as root length and turnover. 4. The lack of a response in root phenology, despite warmer soil temperatures and above-ground phenological advances, adds evidence that above-ground plant responses might not be directly translated to below-ground plant responses, and that our understanding of factors driving below-ground phenology is still limited, although of major importance for water, nutrient and carbon cycling.",2017-07,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a growing realization that herbarium-based collections could offer a reliable and relatively time-saving baseline data source to identify these effects. This article examines the magnitude and trends of warming effects on the average flowering timing (AFT) of plants in Tibet Autonomous Region using analysis of herbarium specimens collected for 4 decades. Mixed model with randomized blocks was used to analyze a set of 41 species (total 909 specimens) which were collected during the period of 1961-2000. Results showed that an earlier AFT emerged within 40 years period in comparison to the recorded data of the year of 2000 (0.5 days per year), and that 7.5 days early flowering was contributed by mean summer (i.e., June-August) temperature. It is proposed that temporary shifts in flowering phenology responding to continuing temperature rise could quantify the extent to which climate affects plant species. Analysis of well recorded herbarium specimens could provide a reasonable indication on the impacts of rising temperature on plant phenology. The result of this study could also facilitate a bridge between the scientific knowledge and indigenous knowledge of Tibetan communities.",2013-01,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present results of a field experiment to test the hypotheses that (1) the timing of phenological events does not necessarily delay as elevation increases; (2) changes in the timing of a sequence of phenological events will be consistent for all phenological events along the elevation gradient; and thus (3) change in the timing of phenological events does not affect the duration of the entire reproductive stage in the alpine region. The experiment was conducted along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 3800 m using two early-spring flowering (ESF) sedges and four mid-summer flowering (MSF) plants (two forbs and two grasses). Generally, our results only supported the first hypothesis. Lower elevation delayed the starting dates of all phenological events for ESF plants at 3200 m compared with other elevations, whereas the opposite trend was observed for MSF-grasses. MSF-forbs had the earliest leaf-out at 3200 m and the earliest first flowering at 3600 m, and onset of fruit-set advanced with increasing elevation. The entire reproductive duration was shortened with increasing elevation for MSF-forbs, whereas it was the shortest for ESF at 3600 m and for MSF-grasses at 3200 and/or 3800 m. Individual reproductive stages had independent responses to climate change. The duration of the entire growing season for ESF plants decreased as elevation increased. For MSF-forbs, it was longest at 3200 m and shortest at 3400 m, while for MSF-grasses it was shortest at 3200 m and at 3800 m. Reproduction was compressed into shorter time periods only for MSF-forbs at 3600 and 3800 m. Therefore, reproduction is not tightly integrated across the life cycle, and earlier reproductive development induced by warmer spring temperatures did not consistently advance flowering and fruiting times and their durations for the alpine plants studied. The effects of climate change on the timing and duration of phenological events were species-specific. Selection for changes in the timing and duration of individual phenological stages in response to climate change due to evolutionary adaptation should be taken into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Herbarium specimens provide a snapshot of the past environmental conditions during their collection. The collection date in a herbarium specimen is a good proxy to determine the flowering period (phenology). In this study, phenological data from subarctic plant specimens collected over 100 years were gathered by using one of the largest herbarium databases in the World. The collection dates of 7146 herbarium specimens were analyzed and significant shifts in the phenology of subarctic plants were detected. In this study, most of the analyzed 142 species in a subarctic biogeographic region tended to flower earlier in the 1950-2018 period compared to the 1900-1949 as a possible result of the climate change. Flowering time shifted from 8 to 26 days in some species. Changes in flowering time may alter species interactions, community composition, and species distribution in a region.

Choosing indicator species to monitor biological responses to climate change may be improved if herbarium specimens are combined with ongoing monitoring efforts to understand phenological responses over longer periods. We analyzed herbarium specimen data from Colorado's alpine region, as alpine areas are predicted to be especially sensitive to climate change. We assessed phenological patterns in relation to temperature and precipitation for 287 species and growing degree days (GDD) for 235 species. Average low temperature, maximum GDD, and average precipitation increased over the study period. As temperature and GDD increased, phenology advanced, but as precipitation increased, phenology was delayed. Even with this variability of environmental responses, a significant trend of earlier flowering appeared when all species were analyzed together. Of the species that showed significantly earlier flowering dates, they advanced on average more than 39 days over the 61 years of the study. When assessing only specimens of species monitored in a national program (USA National Phenology Network), we found that these species showed similar trends to the entire dataset.

We used a 34-yr record of flowering times and flower abundance for four species (two Delphinium [Ranunculaceae] species and two Mertensia [Boraginaceae] species) from a subalpine plant community near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory to test the hypothesis that the phenologies of early-flowering species change more rapidly in response to climatological and other abiotic Cues than do late-flowering species, a pattern previously found in plant communities in North America and Europe. We also explored a related hypothesis, that flower abundance of late-flowering species is more responsive to changes in climate than that of early-flowering species. The Delphinium species did not support these hypotheses, but the Mertensia species did. The difference between the peak flowering times of the early and late Mertensia species is expanding, leading to a period of diminished resources for pollinators that specialize on this genus. Mertensia ciliata Populations are already severely declining in our study area, possibly as a result of earlier snowmelt. Together, these results show that the reported differences between early- and late-flowering species may be widespread, but they are not ubiquitous.",2009-10,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This limits our ability to predict responses to climate change by plant species and communities. To address this gap, we used infrared heaters and manual watering in a fully factorial experiment to determine the relative importance of these climate factors on plant flowering phenology, and response differences among plant functional groups. Heating advanced snowmelt and flower initiation, but exposed plants to colder early-spring conditions in the period prior to first flower, indicating that snowmelt timing, not temperature, advances flowering initiation in the alpine community. Flowering duration was largely conserved; heating did not extend average species flowering into the latter part of the growing season but instead flowering was completed earlier in heated plots. Although passive warming experiments have resulted in warming-induced soil drying suggested to advance flower senescence, supplemental water did not counteract the average species advance in flowering senescence caused by heating or extend flowering in unheated plots, and variation in soil moisture had inconsistent effects on flowering periods. Functional groups differed in sensitivity to earlier snowmelt, with flower initiation most advanced for early-season species and flowering duration lengthened only for graminoids and forbs. We conclude that earlier snowmelt, driven by increased radiative heating, is the most important factor altering alpine flowering phenology. Studies that only manipulate summer temperature will err in estimating the sensitivity of alpine flowering phenology to large-scale warming. The wholesale advance in flowering phenology with earlier snowmelt suggests that alpine communities will track warming, but only alpine forbs and graminoids appear able to take advantage of an extended snow-free season.",2020-09,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although changes in flowering phenology among species under climate change have been reported widely, how species-specific shifts will affect phenological synchrony and community-level phenology patterns remains unclear. We conducted a manipulative experiment of warming and precipitation addition and reduction to explore how climate change affected flowering phenology at the species and community levels in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We found that warming advanced the first and last flowering times differently and with no consistent shifts in flowering duration among species, resulting in the entire flowering period of species emerging earlier in the growing season. Early-flowering species were more sensitive to warming than mid- and late-flowering species, thereby reducing flowering synchrony among species and extending the community-level flowering season. However, precipitation and its interactions with warming had no significant effects on flowering phenology. Our results suggest that temperature regulates flowering phenology from the species to community levels in this alpine meadow community, yet how species shifted their flowering timing and duration in response to warming varied. This species-level divergence may reshape flowering phenology in this alpine plant community.
