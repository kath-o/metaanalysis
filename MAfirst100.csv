KRKCHEPW,journalArticle,2005,"Singh, KP; Kushwaha, CP",Emerging paradigms of tree phenology in dry tropics,CURRENT SCIENCE,,0011-3891,,,"The tropical dry forests constitute a mosaic composed of several phenological functional types adapted to seasonal drought in different ways. Various functional types differ with respect to phenological timing and triggering factors, water relations, extent of deciduousness (similar to leaflessness), etc. Duration of deciduousness in tropical trees (reflecting integrated effect of seasonal drought, tree characteristics and soil moisture conditions) is related to leafing patterns and resource use rates. Vegetative and flowering phenology of trees in dry tropics is primarily affected by the periodicity of rainfall and soil water availability. Occurrence of leaf-flushing as well as flowering during summer in majority of Indian tropical trees, when drought is severe, seems to be a unique adaptation to survive under strongly seasonal climate having a short growth promoting wet period and a long growth constraining dry period. The key phenological themes that need research focus in the dry tropics are: duration of deciduousness, timing of vegetative bud break, leaf strategy, water relations, seasonal flowering types and asynchrony. Analysis of functional types based on the duration of deciduousness and timing of bud break may enable better assessment of future climate change impact. There is a need for long-term quantitative documentation of tree phenological patterns in India through a phenological station network in diverse climatie/vegetational zones.",25/09/2005,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,964-975,,6,89,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA Publisher: INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES Type: Review",,,,climate change; deciduousness; flowering types; functional types; quantitative phenology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two hypotheses were tested: (1) Interspecific synchronization of flowering and fruiting phenology is higher at study sites with pronounced rainfall seasonality compared with sites within perhumid forests. (2) Proximate causes for flowering in closely situated seasonal and perhumid sites are either photoperiodicity or climatic factors. Two nearby study sites with contrasting precipitation patterns were selected at the same altitude east and west of the western Cordillera. Eighty trees from 13 species were observed over a 2.5-y period. Three species were common to both study sites. Phenological and climate data were collected and cross-correlated by conducting a time-series analysis. At the perhumid site, very clear annual patterns of phenological behaviour could be observed for most of the selected rain-forest tree species, but with a poor interspecific synchronization. On the nearby seasonal site in contrast, most species showed high synchrony in their phenological behaviour coinciding with the dry season. There is strong evidence that flowering is induced not by one factor alone: we identified photoperiodic control, radiation and precipitation as possible proximate causes for both sites.

However, it is still unclear as to which climatic factors and biotic interactions drive the reproductive phenology of woody trees in the tropical seasonal rainforest of Xishuangbanna region in Southwest China. We conducted observations on woody plants (including trees and shrubs) phenology between November 2004 and October 2007 at biweekly intervals in the one hectare permanent plot of tropical seasonal rainforest in Southwest China. A total of 357 individuals of 76 species (70 genera, 37 families), comprising of 59 (78%) woody trees and 17 (22%) shrub species were observed. Our results demonstrate that flowering and fruiting frequencies show slight temporal variation between years. Flowering was significantly correlated with day-length, temperature and rainfall and fruiting was significantly correlated with rainfall and temperature. This finding indicates that woody tree reproductive phenology was primarily associated with temperature and rainfall and to a lesser extent with day-length. Reproductive phenology is also linked to seasonal patterns with flowering peaking in the late dry season and fruiting peaking in the late wet season. Moreover, reproductive phenology is also significantly associated with reproductive ecological guilds such as pollination types and dispersal modes. Community reproductive phenology is associated with climatic seasonality and biotic interactions.

We explored phenological patterns in Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park (HNNP) in China and their major climatic and biotic drivers, based on phenological and distribution data for >2000 species from the Flora of Hainan. Specifically, we address the following questions: (1) What are the phenological patterns for all species in HNNP and for Hainan gibbon food plants only? (2) What are the environmental drivers of reproductive phenology? (3) Whether the flowering and fruiting dates are phylogenetic conserved? (4) Does reproductive phenology vary with functional groups, like growth forms, pollination modes and fruit types? Our results show flowering peaks in late spring and early summer, while fruiting phenology was concentrated during late summer and fall. Closely related species tend to have similar flowering and fruiting dates. The number of flowering species was primary controlled by mean maximum monthly temperature while minimum monthly temperature was the most important variable in shaping fruiting patterns of all species. For fruiting of gibbon food plants, mean monthly precipitation was the most important variable. Our study found January to May was food shortage period, which has important implications for Hainan gibbon conservation. We should take targeted ecological restoration by planting gibbon food species with phenologies between January and May, and take targeted provisioning to attract gibbons into a new habitat by providing fruits between January and May.

Here, we present a new model framework able to predict the timing of multiple annual flowering events from census data. We extend a recent model, which predicted tropical flowering probabilities as discrete events occurring on census dates, by integrating predicted flowering probabilities over all dates between censuses. We evaluate our model against 29 years of daily climate and weekly flowering records for Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae) and Handroanthus guayacan (Bignoniaceae) from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Previous experiments demonstrate that both species flower shortly after a heavy, dry-season rain interrupts an extended dry period. Our model captures this sequence of rainfall events. Best-fit model parameters are consistent with previous experimental results.

We found that, although the drought increased fruiting activity in the community relative to the reference plot, species-level response was varied in both phenology and physiology. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity and occurrence of drought in tropical regions, potentially affecting the phenology and physiology of tree species. Phenological activity may respond to a drying and warming environment by advancing reproductive timing and/or diminishing the production of flowers and fruits. These changes have the potential to disrupt important ecological processes, with potentially wide-ranging effects on tropical forest function. Here, we analysed the monthly flowering and fruiting phenology of a tree community (337 individuals from 30 species) over 7 years in a lowland tropical rainforest in northeastern Australia and its response to a throughfall exclusion drought experiment (TFE) that was carried out from 2016 to 2018 (3 years), excluding approximately 30% of rainfall. We further examined the ecophysiological effects of the TFE on the elemental (C:N) and stable isotope (& delta;13C and & delta;15N) composition of leaves, and on the stable isotope composition (& delta;13C and & delta;18O) of stem wood of four tree species. At the community level, there was no detectable effect of the TFE on flowering activity overall, but there was a significant effect recorded on fruiting and varying responses from the selected species. The reproductive phenology and physiology of the four species examined in detail were largely resistant to impacts of the TFE treatment. One canopy species in the TFE significantly increased in fruiting and flowering activity, whereas one understory species decreased significantly in both. There was a significant interaction between the TFE treatment and season on leaf C:N for two species. Stable isotope responses were also variable among species, indicating species-specific responses to the TFE. Thus, we did not observe consistent patterns in physiological and phenological changes in the tree community within the 3 years of TFE treatment examined in this study.",01/01/2023,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,,,1,11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article",,,,flowering; drought; Climate change; fruiting; stable isotopes; water use efficiency; Wet Tropics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive and long-term phenological observations in the tropics are rare and difficult to realise but unpublished historical records have been preserved and are of high value. Phenological data gathered between 1948 and 1957 on 3642 trees of 158 species in the rainforest reserve of Luki, Democratic Republic of Congo were analysed. Patterns of leaf shedding, flowering, fruiting and fruit dispersal were presented for three major functional groups of trees and their relationships with rainfall investigated. Annual rhythms of leaf and reproductive phenology were observed with patterns ranging from synchronous annual peaks to continuity. Over the years, positive association was found between leaf shedding and annual rainfall for shade-tolerant canopy species as well as between reproductive phenology and annual rainfall for long-lived heliophilous and shade-tolerant understorey species. Direct and indirect associations with intra-annual and supra-annual climate variations suggest that changes in environmental conditions may affect phenological patterns of tropical trees thus species interactions and ecosystem dynamics. The different leaf and reproductive phenological patterns found in different functional groups of trees promote the coexistence of numerous tree species in tropical rainforest multispecies communities.

The dry season peak flowering was immediately followed by peak fruiting during pre-monsoon dry period just prior to onset of wet season. Peak flowering in March was significantly correlated with changes in temperature, this synchronized flowering in the dry season also affects the insect's floral visits on the plant. Ripening of fruits during early wet season may offer post dispersal advantage for seeds to germinate and thereby ensuring offspring survival. The finding indicates that both temperature and rainfall strongly influence the seasonality in reproductive phenology of trees of this archipelago.

This increase can alter forest structure and decrease both carbon storage and tree diversity via antagonistic relationships between lianas and their host trees. Climate change is postulated as an underlying driver of increasing liana abundances, via increases in dry-season length, forest-disturbance events, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations; all factors thought to favour lianas. However, the impact of climate change on liana reproductive phenology, an underlying determinant of liana abundance, has been little studied, particularly outside of Neotropical forests. Over a 15-year period (2000-2014), we examined the phenological patterns of a liana community in intact rainforests of the Wet Tropics bioregion of Australia; a World Heritage Area and hotspot of floral diversity. Specifically, we assessed (1) flowering and fruiting patterns of liana species; (2) potential climate drivers of flowering and fruiting activity; and (3) the influence of El Nino-related climatic disturbances on liana phenology. We found that flowering and fruiting of the studied liana species increased over time. Liana reproduction, moreover, rose in apparent response to higher temperatures and reduced rainfall. Finally, we found flowering and fruiting of the liana species increased following El Nino events. These results suggest that liana reproduction and abundance are likely to increase under predicted future climate regimes, with potentially important impacts on the survival, growth, and reproduction of resident trees and thus the overall health of Australian tropical rainforests.",09/06/2022,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",,,,flowering; fruiting; ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation); forest disturbance; rainforest; woody vines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the species level a variety of patterns were exhibited; however, a number of the most common species currently rarely fruit, and when they do, typically < 41% of the individuals take part in fruiting events. Combining the data set from 1990 to 2002 with that from 1970 to 1983 for specific species again reveals an increase in the proportion of trees fruiting between 1990 and 2002: however, the proportion of the populations fruiting decreased during the earlier period. When one examines particular species over this whole period a variety of patterns are evident. For example, Pouteria altissima exhibited a relatively regular pattern of fruiting during the 1970s; however, it rarely fruited in the 1990s. Contrasting phenological patterns at four sites revealed that at the community level the fruiting patterns of only one of the six pair-wise site combinations were correlated. Relationships between rainfall and fruiting were variable among sites. Contrasting changes in fruiting patterns over the 30 y with differences among the four sites varying in rainfall, suggests that the changes observed in fruiting may be due to climate change. Responses to this climate change are likely complex and will vary among species. However, for some species, current conditions appear unsuitable for fruiting.",2005-01,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,31-45,,1,21,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article",,,,climate change; seasonality; flowering; fruiting; tropical trees; Kibale National Park; phenology; seed dispersal; Uganda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the association of local climatic factors and plant size with the reproductive phenology of the threatened cactus Harrisia portoricensis in the Caribbean dry forest of Mona Island. Analyses of phenological data gathered monthly in 572 plants over 2 years concluded that for this species, reproductive activity is continuous throughout the year and reproductive output is positively correlated with plant size. Bud production in H. portoricensis was positively associated with temporal changes in monthly mean and minimum temperatures, while flower production was positively associated with total monthly rainfall. When compared with other columnar cacti species, the combined phenological responses to temperature and rainfall in H. portoricensis represent a different strategy. We hypothesize that contrasting phenological responses among columnar cacti may stem from site-specific differences in the degree of intra-annual rainfall or temperature variability. If that is the case, then monitoring reproductive responses of cacti to expected changes in climate at a global scale would require gathering phenological data for this taxon across different geographic regions.",2011-12,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,861-871,,12,89,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA Publisher: CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS Type: Article",,,,reproductive phenology; Caribbean dry forest; columnar cactus; Harrisia portoricensis; Mona Island; plant size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the strong positional differentiation within tree crowns and the repetition of vegetative and reproductive growth cycles in trees, flower develoment and its control are more complex than in herbaceous plants. Formation of terminal inflorescences, as found in Cedrela, Cordia and Tabebuta, regularly occurs at the end of a flush of determinate shoot growth; flower initiation, like shoot growth cessation, is controlled by internal, correlative factors rather than by environmental changes. Initiation of lateral inflorescences is usually preceded by growth cessation in the indeterminate, vegetative shoot, but the timing and control of flower induction in lateral buds are unknown. For many tropical trees, particularly those growing in seasonal climates, flower development is discontinuous, i.e., flower initiation and anthesis are separated by a prolonged rest period and must be controlled separately. Delayed anthesis is usually triggered by rehydration of previously water-stressed trees resulting from leaf shedding or, in dry habitats, by rainfall. Because of different degrees of seasonal water stress, leaf fall and subsequent anthesis in several species extend over 3-4 mo. The observed periodicity of anthesis in tropical trees is thus largely determined by seasonal changes in tree water status and is unlikely to be the result of selection for optimum tree-pollinator interaction.",1983,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,81-89,,2,15,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anomalously warm equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures affect rainfall and temperature throughout the tropics and coincide with altered leaf flush phenology and increased fruit production in wet tropical forests; however, the understanding of mechanisms underlying this pattern is limited. There is evidence that increases in tropical tree reproduction anticipate El Nino onset, motivating the continued search for a global driver of tropical angiosperm reproduction. We present the solar-wind energy flux hypothesis: that physical energy influx to the Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere, generated by a positive anomaly in the solar wind preceding El Nino development, cues tropical trees to increase resource allocation to reproduction. Methods We test this hypothesis using 19 years of data from Luquillo, Puerto Rico, correlating them with measures of solar-wind energy. Results From 1994 to 2013, the solar-wind energy flux into Earth's magnetosphere (E-in) was more strongly correlated with the number of species fruiting and flowering than the Nino 3.4 climate index, despite Nino 3.4 being previously identified as a driver of interannual increases in reproduction. Conclusions Changes in the global magnetosphere and thermosphere conditions from increased solar-wind energy affect global atmospheric pressure and circulation patterns, principally by weakening the Walker circulation. We discuss the idea that these changes cue interannual increases in tropical tree reproduction and act through an unidentified mechanism that anticipates and synchronizes the reproductive output of the tropical trees with El Nino.",2019-11,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,1519-1525,,11,106,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,flowering; reproductive phenology; fruiting; tropical trees; El Nino Southern Oscillation; Luquillo; solar wind; solar-wind energy flux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leaf shedding of two species was observed for 12 months. Parallel to the phenological recordings, meteorological parameters were monitored in detail and related to the flowering and fruiting activity of the trees. In spite of the perhumid climate of that area, a high degree of intra- and inter-specific synchronisation of phenological traits was apparent. With the exception of one species that flowered more or less continuously, two groups of trees could be observed, one of which flowered during the less humid months (September to October) while the second group started to initiate flowers towards the end of that phase and flowered during the heavy rains (April to July). As reflected by correlation coefficients, the all-time series of meteorological parameters showed a distinct seasonality of 8-12 months, apparently following the quasi-periodic oscillation of precipitation and related cloudiness. As revealed by power spectrum analysis and Markov persistence, rainfall and minimum temperature appear to be the only parameters with a periodicity free of long-term variations. The phenological events of most of the plant species showed a similar periodicity of 8-12 months, which followed the annual oscillation of relatively less and more humid periods and thus was in phase or in counter-phase with the oscillations of the meteorological parameters. Periods of unusual cold or dryness, presumably resulting from underlying longer-term trends or oscillations (such as ENSO), affected the homogeneity of quasi-12-month flowering events, fruit maturation and also the production of germinable seeds. Some species show underlying quasi-2-year-oscillations, for example that synchronise with the development of air temperature; others reveal an underlying decrease or increase in flowering activity over the observation period, influenced for instance by solar irradiance. As Ecuador suffers the highest rate of deforestation in South America, there is an urgent need for indigenous plant material for reforestation.

Location The four TDFs in Guanacaste (Costa Rica), Yucatan, Jalisco and Sonora (Mexico) are characterized by a 5-7 month long dry season and are located along a gradient of increasing latitude (10-30degreesN). Methods To dissect the differences in flowering periodicity observed at the community level, individual tree species were assigned to `flowering types', i.e. groups of species with characteristic flowering periods determined by similar combinations of environmental flowering cues and vegetative phenology. Results Large variation in the fraction of species and flowering types blooming during the dry and wet season, respectively, indicates large differences in the severity of seasonal drought among the four forests. In the dry upland forests of Jalisco, flowering of leafless trees remains suppressed during severe seasonal drought and is triggered by the first rains of the wet season. In the other forests, leaf shedding, exceptional rainfall or increasing daylength cause flowering of many deciduous species at various times during the dry season, well before the summer rains. The fraction of deciduous species leafing out during the summer rains and flowering when leafless during the dry season is largest in the Sonoran TDF. Main conclusions In many wide-ranging species the phenotypic plasticity of flowering periodicity is large. The distinct temporal separation of spring flowering on leafless shoots and subsequent summer flushing represents a unique adaptation of tree development to climates with a relatively short rainy season and a long dry season. Seasonal variation in rainfall and soil water availability apparently constitutes not only the proximate, but also the ultimate cause of flowering periodicity, which is unlikely to have evolved in response to biotic adaptive pressures.",2004-09,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,409-425,,5,13,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article",,,,Costa Rica; flower induction; flowering phenology; Mexico; photoperiodic control; rainfall periodicity; tropical deciduous forest; tropical tree phenology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reserve has 76.20 ha of tropical coastal vegetation (Restinga forest). The aims were to determine the existence of seasonal phenological pattern of woody species as a function of rainfall. During the Study period, the rainfall was 26.8 mm in the driest month (November 2003) and 538.9 in the wettest (June 2004). Observations on flowering, fruiting, leaf fall, and leaf flushing were recorded monthly, during 16 months (April 2003 to July 2004). All species with a ground level perimeter > 10 cm and represented by at least three individuals, were selected and tagged. A total of 51 species represented by 156 individuals were recorded. Leaf flushing and leaf fall did not have seasonal variation and the species continued to gain and loose leaves during the dry (August to February) and rainy (March to July) seasons. Flowering, when evaluated by the Fournier's percentage, varied between 1.9% and 20.2%, with maximum intensity in December 2003 (16.4%) and January 2004 (20.2%).

Although our understanding of geographic variation in habitat-wide timing and frequency of flowering and fruiting is advancing, corresponding information for individual tree species is limited. Thus, we compared climate and reproductive phenology of 16 tree species over 70 mo at two Bornean tropical peat-swamp forest sites. We found significant inter-site correlations in rainfall and temperature, and only small absolute temperature differences. In both sites, most species exhibited within-site synchrony in flowering and fruiting onset. Broad-scale flowering and fruiting onset frequency classifications showed high congruence between sites. Significant correlations in flowering and fruiting onset timing between sites were found for only 19 and 17 percent of the species, respectively. This remained the case when applying 1- and 2-month lag periods for both sites, with neither site consistently lagging behind. Significant differences in the exact frequency of new flowering and fruiting events were detected for 44 and 58 percent of species, respectively, and no significant relationships between the onset timing synchrony and exact frequency of new reproductive events were found for either flowers or fruit. We conclude that inter-site climatic and ecological similarities do not necessarily lead to high inter-site synchrony in either onset timing or exact frequency of tree reproductive events.

Annual diameter growth rates by Swietenia macrophylla demonstrated strong positive correlation with annual rainfall totals during 19972009; Hymenaea courbaril growth rates demonstrated weak positive correlation, whereas Parkia pendula exhibited weak negative correlation. For both Swietenia and Hymenaea, annual diameter growth rates correlated positively and significantly with rainfall totals during the first 6 mo of the growing year (July to December). Vernier dendrometer bands monitored at 4-wk intervals during 35 yr confirmed strong seasonal effects on stem diameter expansion. Individuals of all three species expanded in unison during wet season months and were static or even contracted during dry season months. Stems of the deciduous Swietenia contracted as crowns were shed during the early dry season, expanded slightly as new crowns were flushed, and then contracted further during 35 wk flowering periods in the late dry season by newly mature crowns. The three species physiographic distribution patterns at the study site may partially underlie observed differences in annual and seasonal growth. With most global circulation models predicting conditions becoming gradually drier in southeast Amazonia over the coming decades, species such as Swietenia that perform best on the wet end of current conditions may experience reduced growth rates.

However, they may exhibit interannual differences in synchrony and intensity of phenophases, as strategy for large variations in duration and intensity of rainfall pulses. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how phenophases of deciduous trees of the Brazilian semi-arid region respond to rainfall variations. The phenology of Cordia oncocalyx was monitored in deciduous thorny woodland (Caatinga), from April 2009 to March 2011, and was correlated with rainfall, soil humidity, temperature, and photoperiod. The rainy years 2009 and 2011 exhibited higher duration of rainfall pulses and lower frequency of interpulses, but in 2010 pulse duration and total rainfall were lower. Circular statistics showed leaf flush followed by flowering and fruiting in the rainy season, and leaf fall and seed dispersal in the dry season. Both the vegetative and reproductive phenophases respond similarly to variations in rain pulses, with adjustments in time, duration, and intensity, which were correlated with variations in rainfall and soil humidity, excluding photoperiod as a trigger. Total defoliation occurred in the driest months of each year, November to December 2009 and August to October 2010. A sporadic leaf flush in November 2010 was triggered by occasional rains. Vegetative and reproductive synchronies were high in rainy years, but in 2010 synchrony was low, flowering was delayed and reduced, and, despite the low fruiting, we recorded high density in the seed bank. Lower synchrony, temporal separation of phenophases, and storage of fruits on the ground were risk-spreading strategies used by the population in the dry year, which suggest intrapopulation variability in responses to hydric stress. We believe that this plasticity contributes to high species density in the Caatinga.",2013-12,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,643-651,,4,24,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA Publisher: NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV Type: Article",,,,seasonality; phenology; asynchrony; circular analysis; deciduous; risk spreading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flowering patterns have been analysed against the predictions of three overlapping hypotheses based on climatic, biotic and phylogenetic explanations. No one hypothesis is supported to the exclusion of the others. Patterns of flowering in the Wet Tropics show marked seasonal increases and decreases, except in the northern lowlands. In general this seasonality correlates with rainfall and temperature and is exacerbated by increasing latitude and altitude. There is little or no statistical evidence for the over-dispersion of flowering times that would indicate a competition-avoidance mechanism: flowering within taxa or morphological groups tends to be clumped (and if not, is random). That clumping of flowering within taxa does not coincide with a single season provides support for a mass action hypothesis based on the minimization of generalist predation and/or the avoidance of flower predation. Timing of flowering did show some consistency among species within genera and within families, but there was little consistency at higher taxonomic levels. Clear separation of the biotic and phylogenetic hypotheses requires greater knowledge of pollination ecology and phylogeny of this large and diverse flora. Understanding of flowering patterns and their underlying determining mechanisms is a key to assessing the ecosystem health of the forest.

These Neotropical forests are typically called aseasonal with reference to climate because they are ever-wet, and it is often assumed they are also aseasonal with respect to phenology. The physiological limits to plant reproduction imposed by water and light availability are difficult to disentangle in seasonal forests because these variables are often temporally correlated, and both are rarely studied together, challenging our understanding of their relative importance as drivers of reproduction. Here we report on the first long-term study (18 years) of flowering and fruiting phenology in a diverse equatorial forest, Yasuni in eastern Ecuador, and the first to include a full suite of on-site monthly climate data. Using twice monthly censuses of 200 traps and >1000 species, we determined whether reproduction at Yasuni is seasonal at the community and species levels and analyzed the relationships between environmental variables and phenology. We also tested the hypothesis that seasonality in phenology, if present, is driven primarily by irradiance. Both the community- and species-level measures demonstrated strong reproductive seasonality at Yasuni. Flowering peaked in September-November and fruiting peaked in March-April, with a strong annual signal for both phenophases. Irradiance and rainfall were also highly seasonal, even though no month on average experienced drought (a month with <100 mm rainfall). Flowering was positively correlated with current or near-current irradiance, supporting our hypothesis that the extra energy available during the period of peak irradiance drives the seasonality of flowering at Yasuni. As Yasuni is representative of lowland ever-wet equatorial forests of northwestern Amazonia, we expect that reproductive phenology will be strongly seasonal throughout this region.",2023-09,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,,,9,104,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,seasonality; flowering; rainfall; tropical forest; phenology; seed dispersal; daylength; fruit development; Neotropical; solar irradiance; synchrony; Yasuni National Park,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We chose two sites: one close to a permanent water source, locally known as `cenote' (the CC site, ground water table was found at 2 m) and the other far from the cenote (FC site ground water table was at a depth of 10 m). Sites mainly differed in soil depth (FC site having greater soil depth) and soil nutrient characteristics (FC site more potassium, CC site more phosphorous). Our results indicated significant differences in phenology within species between sites and years, with leaf, flower and fruit production tending to be higher at the CC site and in the year 2004. Wood density and xylem water potentials were negatively related to each other, and midday water potentials were higher at the CC site. Differences in phenology found among years suggest that the timing of rainfall as well as the duration of periods without rain may play a more important role in phenology than total annual precipitation. Also differences inter-sites suggest a strong effect of site on tree phenology.

Analysis is further constrained by the limited duration of many phenological datasets. To address these limitations, we developed a predictive ecoinformatic model using multivariate linear regression and slope correlation analysis that can uncover statistically significant biological responses within short, noisy ecological time series. Our approach correlates all possible combinations of climatic and taxonomic variables using a series of random determination trials on shuffled environmental data. Seasonal and annual fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, and sunlight were used to predict the reproductive response of each individual taxon. This predictive model was applied to two seasonally sampled aerial pollen records collected between 1996 and 2006 from two Panamanian forests, Barro Colorado Island and Parque Nacional San Lorenzo. Our results highlight the degree to which pollen output responds to fine-scale variability in climate. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that the pollen output of tropical species is diminished with prolonged periods of heavy rainfall and that pollen output is sensitive to small, seasonal increases in temperature.

However, differences in soil physicochemical properties can also drive resource availability, potentially affecting plant phenology, especially under similar environments in terms of rainfall regime. We determined whether the seasonality and synchrony of the vegetative and reproductive phenophases differ along a grassland-savanna-forest gradient under the same climate regime in a Neotropical seasonal ecosystem. We hypothesized that species growing on shallow, nutrient-impoverished soils have a higher capacity to respond to precipitation pulses than those on rich soils. Location Serra do Cipo, southeastern Brazil. Methods We quantified soil physicochemical properties associated with fertility and water retention of the grassland (campo rupestre), savanna (cerrado) and forest, and determined the phenological strategies of 70 species across the three vegetation types by monitoring vegetative and reproductive phenophases over one year. For each phenophase, in each vegetation type, we evaluated the seasonality and synchrony of phenological patterns. We quantified the phylogenetic signal for phenophases to disentangle the relative roles of historical vs ecological drivers of plant phenology. Results Soils from campo rupestre were more nutrient- and water-limited than those of cerrado and forest. Cerrado and forest communities had similar phenological strategies, whereas species from campo rupestre showed strategies that maximize resource acquisition and conservation. In the cerrado and forest, leafing and flowering patterns were seasonal, with leaf flushing and flowering peaking at the onset of the rainy season and leaf senescence in the dry season. Conversely, species from campo rupestre showed continuous leafing and flowering patterns, while fruiting was seasonal. Phenophases did not show a phylogenetic signal. Conclusions We demonstrated changes in vegetative and reproductive phenology that are likely associated with variations in soil physicochemical properties.

Flower occurrence peaked at the beginning of the short dry season followed by a pronounced trough during the beginning and the middle of the short wet season.

Fruit scarcity was observed for a 4-month period spanning September to December and most flushing of leaves noted at the end of the wet season in November and December. Our binomial generalized linear mixed models indicated that flowering and fruiting were negatively associated with temperature and that leafing activity was positively associated with rainfall and temperature. These findings are consistent with the insolation- and water-limitation hypotheses suggesting that the seasonally varying availability of resources such as light, water, and nutrients determines these phenological patterns.

Two sites, a wetter site I receiving 1100mm and a drier site II receiving 600mm of rainfall annually, are compared. A total of 286 trees from 38 species at site I and 167 trees from 27 species at site II was marked for phenological observations. There were 11 species common to the two sites. Several hypotheses relating to the evolution of reproductive phenology are tested. 2 Frequency of species flowering attained a peak at site I during the dry season but at site II, where soil moisture may be limiting during the dry months, the peak was during the wet season. At both sites a majority of species flushed leaves and flowered simultaneously. Among various guilds, the bird-pollinated guild showed distinct dry season flowering, which may be related to better advertisement of large flowers to pollinators during the leafless dry phase. The wind-pollinated guild flowered mainly during the wet season, when wind speeds are highest and favourable for pollen transport. The insect-pollinated guild showed no seasonality in flowering in site I but a wet season flowering in site II. 3 Fruiting frequency attained a peak in site I during the late wet season extending into the early dry season; a time-lag correlation showed that fruiting followed rainfall with a lag of about two months. Site II showed a similar fruiting pattern but this was not statistically significant. The dispersal guilds (animal, wind, and explosive passively-dispersed) did not show any clear seasonality in fruiting, except for the animal-dispersed guild which showed wet season fruiting in site I. 4 Hurlbert's overlap index was also calculated in order to look at synchrony in flowering and fruiting irrespective of climatic (dry and wet month) seasonality. In general, overlap in flowering and fruiting guilds was high because of seasonal aggregation. Among the exceptions, at site II the wind-pollinated flowering guild did not show significant overlap between species although flowering aggregated in the wet season. This could be due to the need to avoid heterospecific pollen transfer. 5 Rarer species tended to flower earlier in the dry season and this again could be an adaptation to avoid the risk of heterospecific pollen transfer or competition for pollinators. The more abundant species flowered mainly during the wet season. Species which flower earlier have larger flowers and, having invested more energy in flowers, also have shorter flower to fruit durations.",1994-12,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,759-767,,4,82,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL Publisher: BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD Type: Article",,,,COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; FRUITING PHENOLOGY; MUDUMALAI SANCTUARY; POLLINATION AND DISPERSAL GUILDS; SOUTHERN INDIA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Figs were least abundant during the early dry period (June-September) and most abundant from the late dry season (October-November) through the wet season (December-April). The annual peak in reproduction actually reflected two staggered peaks arising from gender differences in fig phenology. In this dioecious species, female and male trees initiated their maximal fig crops at different times and flowering was to some extent synchronized within sexes. Fig production in the female (seed-producing) trees was typically confined to the wet season. Male (wasp-producing) trees were less synchronized than female trees but reached a peak level of fig production in the months prior to the onset of female fig production.

Community-wide recruitment reached a maximum in the wet season, whereas no recruitment occurred during the dry season. We observed a unimodal peak in rainfall and fruit production, and the periodicity and intensity of seed production were significantly correlated with rainfall seasonality (the optimal time for germination). Flowering at the community and system levels lagged behind a significant increase and subsequent decrease in rainfall by 7 and 3 mo, respectively, indicating that the dominant factor controlling flowering periodicity is the passage of the major (4-mo long) rainy season and changes in soil moisture conditions. Fruiting lagged behind flowering by 2 mo and a significant increase in fruiting occurred 2 mo prior to a significant increase in rainfall. At the population level, a correspondence analysis identified a major dichotomy in the patterns of flowering and fruiting between species and indicated two broad species groups based oil their time of peak fruiting and the number of times they were in fruit. These were either individuals which were usually in peak fruit 1-2 mo prior to the start of the major rainy season or those that were in fruit more or less continuously throughout the year with no peak fruiting time.

We quantified fruiting for 326 trees from 43 species and evaluated these patterns in relation to solar radiance, rainfall, and monthly temperature. We used time-lagged variables based on seasonality in linear regression models to assess the effect of abiotic variables on the proportion of fruiting trees. Annual fruiting varied over 3.8-fold, and inter-annual variation in fruiting is associated with the extent of fruiting in the peak period, not variation in time of fruit set. While temperature and rainfall showed positive effects on fruiting, solar radiance in thetwo-year period encompassing a given year and the previous year was the strongest predictor of fruiting. As solar irradiance was the strongest predictor of fruiting, the projected increase in rainfall associated with climate change, and coincident increase in cloud cover suggest that climate change will lead to a decrease in fruiting.

In turn, many of these fauna are dependent on the flowering phenology of the plant species of such ecosystems. The impact of changes in climate, including climate extremes, on the interaction between these fauna and flora has not been identified or elucidated, yet influences on flowering phenology are already evident. These changes are well documented in the mid to high latitudes. However, there is emerging evidence that the flowering phenology, nectar/pollen production, and fruit production of long-lived trees in tropical and subtropical forests are also being impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of climate extremes. Here, we examine the implications of these changes for vertebrate fauna dependent on these resources. We review the literature to establish evidence for links between climate extremes and flowering phenology, elucidating the nature of relationships between different vertebrate taxa and flowering regimes. We combine this information with climate change projections to postulate about the likely impacts on nectar, pollen and fruit resource availability and the consequences for dependent vertebrate fauna. The most recent climate projections show that the frequency and intensity of climate extremes will increase during the 21st century. These changes are likely to significantly alter mass flowering and fruiting events in the tropics and subtropics, which are frequently cued by climate extremes, such as intensive rainfall events or rapid temperature shifts. We find that in these systems the abundance and duration of resource availability for vertebrate fauna is likely to fluctuate, and the time intervals between episodes of high resource availability to increase. The combined impact of these changes has the potential to result in cascading effects on ecosystems through changes in pollinator and seed dispersal ecology, and demands a focused research effort.",2015-09,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,3267-3277,,9,21,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Review",,,,flowering; fruiting; climate extremes; ecosystem processes; extreme climate events; frugivores; nectarivores; tree reproductive phenology; vertebrate species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used wavelet analyses to examine phenology of community flower and seed production for 45 tree species across multiple temporal scales in a tropical dry forest in Puerto Rico with marked rainfall seasonality. Weasked three questions: (1) do species exhibit synchronous or compensatory temporal dynamics in reproduction, (2) do interspecific differences in phenology reflect variable responses to rainfall, and (3) is interspecific variation in phenology and response to a major drought associated with functional traits that mediate responses to moisture? Community-level flowering was synchronized at seasonal scales (similar to 5-6mo) and at short scales (similar to 1 mo, following rainfall). However, seed rain exhibited significant compensatory dynamics at intraseasonal scales (similar to 3 mo), suggesting interspecific variation in temporal niches. Species with large leaves (associated with sensitivity to water deficit) peaked in reproduction synchronously with the peak of seasonal rainfall (similar to 5mo scale). By contrast, species with high wood specific gravity (associated with drought resistance) tended to flower in drier periods. Flowering of tall species and those with large leaves was most tightly linked to intraseasonal (similar to 2mo scale) rainfall fluctuations. Although the 2015 drought dramatically reduced community-wide reproduction, functional traits were not associated with the magnitude of species-specific declines. Our results suggest opposing drivers of synchronous versus compensatory dynamics at different temporal scales. Phenology associations with functional traits indicated that distinct strategies for coping with seasonality underlie phenological diversity. Observed drought responses highlight the importance of non-linear community responses to climate. Community phenology exhibits scale-specific patterns highlighting the need for multi-scale approaches to community dynamics.",2016-11,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND Publisher: IOP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article",,,,drought; precipitation; community assembly; lag effects; time-series,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 210 mature trees were monitored for leaf fall, leaf flush, flowering and fruiting. The different phenophase events were correlated with climate variables and circular statistics was employed to test for seasonality. Leaf fall and leaf flush peaked during the long dry season. Leaf fall significantly correlated with mean monthly temperatures. Flowering was predominantly annual and seasonal. Most species flowered during the dry season between November and May. Flowering was temporally discordant among the species, which is interpreted as a kind of adaptation avoiding interspecific overlap and thus competition for pollinators. Unlike flowering, fruiting was less seasonal and trees bore fruits over extended periods of the year. Following flowering, fruiting peaked later in the dry season or the beginning of the rainy season. Both flowering and fruiting phenology of the study species were strongly influenced by temperature and rainfall.

Broad phenological patterns, especially the timing of reproduction, may result from long-term climate trends and co-evolution between plants and their pollinators, dispersers, and predators. Yet, interannual climate variation and local abiotic conditions may also affect the timing and magnitude of plant reproduction. Understanding the patterns of and controls on plant reproduction are crucial for conservation efforts under a changing global climate and rapidly expanding human development. However, phenology studies from the Neotropics are sparse. Here, we examine the relative timing and magnitude of fleshy-fruited plant reproduction during the winter dry season in subtropical dry forest on Eleuthera, The Bahamas over a nine-year period. At least 47 species were observed with some dry season reproductive activity, but only 17% showed evidence of a fruiting peak or continuous reproduction. Overall fruit abundance generally declined through the dry season, but flower production increased between mid and late dry season. Variation in fruit and flower abundance among years was related to temperature and rainfall, but local site conditions-particularly successional stage and groundwater availability-explained more variability in reproductive activity than climate variation. Groundwater availability had a particularly strong positive influence on flower and fruit abundance at the end of the dry season, a critical time for migrant frugivores preparing to return to their breeding grounds. This emphasizes the importance of protecting sites with accessible groundwater to conserve biodiversity in the archipelago and elsewhere.",2024-01,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,170-184,,1,56,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,reproductive phenology; tropical dry forest; bird conservation; climate variation; Erithalis fruticosa; freshwater lens aquifer; Lantana involucrata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, we used long-terms records at a nearby meteorological station to determine the probability of a rain event exceeding a particular intensity (mm). For our seven species (particularly the two most common species: Cordia alliodora and Piptadenia constricta), we found that the degree of budburst and leaf extension was a function of irrigation intensity.

Further, there was no effect of intensity on subsequent relative growth rate in the following wet season.

The hypotheses addressed are largely complementary to one another. Strong environmental restrictions conditioned general flowering patterns with species endogenous characteristics acting secondarily.

Therefore, we examined the phenology of an evergreen dipterocarp forest in a climate exhibiting seasonal drought in Southeast Asia, with the aim of evaluating what evidence it brings to bear on the hypothesis that reproductive phenology in contemporary dipterocarp forests is the product of evolutionarily conserved responses to seasonal drought. We hypothesized that (1) dipterocarp forests that experience seasonal drought would exhibit annual reproduction and seasonality similar to that of forests with similar climates in other parts of the world, (2) within species, flowering frequency would be climate-dependent, not a fixed trait, and (3) climatic events that cue flowering in everwet forests would also cue flowering in seasonally dry forests. From 2001 to 2009, we monitored flowering and fruiting monthly for 1,344 trees (>300 spp.) in a forest in Khao Chong (KC), Thailand that experiences an annual 2-4month dry season, assessing frequency, duration, seasonality and synchrony of reproduction. We also examined phenological records for trees in three dipterocarp-dominated forests in everwet climates. Reproductive phenology of the KC forest was more similar to tropical forests with similar rainfall seasonality in other parts of the world than it was to dipterocarp-dominated forests in everwet regions of Southeast Asia. The forest exhibited annual reproduction, with peak flowering occurring at the end of the dry season and peak fruiting occurring early in the wet season. Approximately half of all species and individuals reproduced annually, including several species that are known to exhibit general flowering in everwet climates. Short dry spells appeared to cue flowering for early flowering species, while later flowering species may have responded to either low precipitation or temperature, consistent with data from everwet forests. GF behaviour also showed significant phylogenetic signal. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the phenological behaviour of both seasonal and everwet dipterocarp forests may have initially evolved in response to seasonal drought and that the general flowering phenomenon is a product of evolutionary conservatism.",2018-01,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,126-136,,1,106,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,fruiting; Dipterocarpaceae; general flowering; determinants of plant community diversity and structure; monsoon forests; reproduction; seasonally dry tropical forests; Southeast Asia; Thailand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypotheses concerning variation in the timing and intensity of rainfall failed to predict flowering times in any species. In contrast, 10 to 12weeks of consistent high levels of irradiance predicted flowering times well for eight species, and six or seven weeks of rapidly increasing levels of irradiance predicted flowering times well for two species. None of the six possible proximate cues predicted flowering times adequately for the nine remaining species. We conclude that high and increasing levels of irradiance are the proximate cues for flowering in many BCI species. The seasonal movements of the Intertropical Convergence Zone cause strong seasonal changes in cloud cover, atmospheric transmissivity, and irradiance reaching the BCI forest. Inter-annual variation in the timing of movements of the Intertropical Convergence Zone is the most likely cause of inter-annual variation in the timing of flowering in these species. Much work remains to be done as the physiological mechanisms linking flowering and irradiance are unknown and the proximate cues for flowering remain to be identified for many other BCI species. Resumen Se compararon los tiempos de floracion predichos por seis senales proximales posibles con lluvia e irradiacion y tiempos de floracion observados durante 30 anos de censos semanales para 19 especies de arboles y lianas de la Isla Barro Colorado (BCI), Panama. Las hipotesis relativas a la variacion en el tiempo y la intensidad de la precipitacion no pudieron predecir los tiempos de floracion en ninguna especie. Por el contrario, entre 10 y 12 semanas de consistentes niveles altos de irradiancia pronosticaron buenos tiempos de floracion para ocho especies, y seis o siete semanas de niveles de irradiancia de rapido aumento pronosticaron los tiempos de floracion para dos especies. Ninguna de las seis senales proximales posibles predijo los tiempos de floracion adecuadamente para las nueve especies restantes. Concluimos que niveles altos y crecientes de irradiancia son las senales cercanas para la floracion en muchas especies de BCI. Los movimientos estacionales de la zona de convergencia intertropical causan fuertes cambios estacionales en la cobertura de las nubes, la transmisividad atmosferica y la irradiancia alcanzan el bosque de BCI. La variacion interanual en el momento de los movimientos de la zona de convergencia intertropical es la causa mas probable de la variacion interanual en el momento de la floracion en estas especies. Todavia queda mucho por hacer, ya que los mecanismos fisiologicos que vinculan la floracion y la irradiacion son desconocidos y las senales cercanas para la floracion aun deben identificarse para muchas otras especies de BCI.",2018-05,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,374-383,,3,50,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,rainfall; Barro Colorado Island; phenology; flowering times; moisture availability; solar insolation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a large-scale experimental reduction of throughfall in an eastern-central Amazon forest to study the phenological response to drought of an abundant subcanopy tree, Coussarea racemosa. We hypothesized that drought would alter the production and the timing of reproduction, as well as the number of viable fruits. The study system comprised two 1-ha plots in the Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil: a dry plot where 50% of incoming precipitation (80% throughfall) was diverted from the soil during the six-month wet season beginning in January 2000, and a wet plot that received natural rainfall inputs. Fruit production of C. racemosa was quantified every 15 days using 100 litter traps (0.5 m(2)) in each plot. The production of new leaves and flowers was recorded monthly for C. racemosa individuals. Soil water, pre-dawn leaf water potential and solar radiation were measured to help interpret phenological patterns. Over the -3.5-year period (April 2000 through December 2003), total fruit production remained similar between plots, declining by 12%. In 2003, production was four times higher in both plots than in previous years. In the dry plot, fruit fall shifted 40 and 60 days later into the dry season in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Total fruit fall dry mass production was variable across the study period. Foliage and flower production coincided with peak irradiance early in the dry season until delays in flowering appeared in the dry plot in 2002 and 2003.

Phenological observations were made weekly by walking along a 10.5 km trail in the interior and at the forest edges of the Santa Genebra Reserve (SGR). The most species-rich families of climbers were Bignoniaceae (22), Malpighiaceae (17), Sapindaceae (12) and Asteraceae (12). Flowering patterns for woody lianas and herbaceous vines differed. Lianas had two flowering peaks: a minor peak in March in the transition from wet to dry season, and a major peak in October during the transition from dry to wet season. The flowering peak for herbaceous vines was in April. Fruiting of lianas was highly seasonal, with one peak in the late dry season (July-August). Fruiting for vines was less seasonal with a slight peak in March. These differences were consistent with the predominance of wind-dispersed fruits among lianas (72% of species) versus vines (52%). Low rainfall, high leaf fall, and strong winds during the dry season favor wind dispersal. More species of vines (40%) have animal-dispersed seeds than lianas (19%), and most vines fruited during the wet season. Phenological patterns of climbers and trees and treelets at SGR differed. The life form of lianas and their system of reserve economy may allow them to reproduce during periods unfavorable to trees. Displacement of peak flowering periods of trees and climbers pollinated by bees and small generalist insects may decrease competition for pollen vectors among species of these two groups of plants. Whereas the fruiting patterns of wind-dispersed trees and climbers at SGR were similar (most species fruiting during the dry season), animal-dispersed trees and treelets fruited throughout the year while animal-dispersed climbers exhibited a pronounced peak in late wet season. The distinct phenological patterns of climbers, generally complementary to those presented by trees, resulted in constant availability of Bowers and fruits throughout the year and enhances the importance of this plant group in Neotropical forests.",1996-06,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,180-191,,2,28,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN 2345 TOWER GROVE AVE, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 Publisher: ASSN TROP BIOL Type: Article",,,,seasonality; flowering; tropical forest; fruiting; phenology; Brazil; climbers; lianas; vines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four species (19%) showed trends of extension in growing season (average of 3.5 d y(-1)). These vegetative events appeared to be mainly influenced by increasing temperature. Rainfall showed little effects directly, however, the effects of temperature seemed to largely depend on the moisture condition. Flowering duration of five species (24%) was shortened by average 2.1 d y(-1) which was most likely to be the result of the decline in sunshine duration during the rainy season.

Intraspecific synchrony in flowering and fruiting of eight woody species was estimated by monitoring 20 individuals of each. Flowering and fruiting occurred mainly during the rainy season and at the beginning of the dry season (Jul-Dec) and showed a low degree of seasonality. Reproductive activity within growth forms occurred in different periods: 1) annual and perennial herbs flowered principally during the rainy season and at the beginning of the dry season, while their fruiting peaked during the dry season; 2) shrubs produced flowers and fruits throughout the year without peaks in any season; and 3) nearly all trees had flowers and fruits during the dry season. Correlations of the number of flowering species at community level and perennial herbs against rainfall showed a significant positive relationship. However a negative relationship was found between rainfall and number of fruiting species in shrubs and trees. High reproductive synchrony (> 60% of individuals in the same phenological phase) was detected in five tree species.

Limitations in our knowledge on the phenological patterns of native species result in the lack of efficient collecting protocols. Here we analyze the reproductive phenology of 14 native tree species from Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) that are widely used in reforestation and restoration programs. We conducted monthly observations during five years through a community-based monitoring program in two conservation areas within the Zicuiran-Infiernillo Biosphere Reserve (West Mexico) to assess the flowering and fruiting phenology of 149 marked trees (7-20 trees per species). For each species we described the phenophase intensity, duration, seasonality, synchrony and frequency. We related the intensity of reproductive phenology to climatic variables (photoperiod, precipitation and temperature). We identified three main phenological strategies of SDTF species that differ in timing and climatic triggers: (1) flowering and fruiting exclusively in the rainy season; (2) flowering in the rainy season and fruiting in the dry season; and (3) flowering and fruiting exclusively in the dry season. For each phenological strategy we make recommendations of optimal collecting seeds schedules. The community-based monitoring program, which involves the participation of local social actors, guaranteed the success of long-term phenological monitoring.

Here, we used litterfall and climatic data during 1998-2017 at four evergreen forest sites in southern China to analyze temporal variations of community phenology and their climate drivers. Results show that two southwest forests have unimodal patterns with leaf litterfall peaks during dry season, while two southeast forests have bimodal patterns with the first peaks during rainy season and the second peaks during rainy and dry seasons respectively. Peaks of flower litterfall for the four forests occurred during the transitional period between dry and rainy seasons, while peaks of fruit litterfall appeared either at the end of the rainy season at the two southern sites or in the dry season at the two northern sites. Leaf litterfall correlates significantly positively with preseason maximum temperature at the four sites, but significantly negatively with preseason precipitation at two southwest sites. By contrast, flower and fruit litterfall correlates significantly positively with preseason temperature and precipitation at only three and two sites. Moreover, leaf, flower, and fruit litterfall exhibits a 12-month cycle, which is consistent with the 12-month cycle of monthly temperature and precipitation. Flower and fruit litterfall displays also multiyear cycles between 18 and 48 months, however, it is inconsistent with the multiyear cycles of monthly temperature and precipitation.

Location Goa state is located between 15degrees48' N and 14degrees53'54” N and 74degrees20'13” E and 73degrees40'33” E, in the northern part of the Western Ghats, India. Method A list of endemic plants from the study area was prepared using available floristic works and checklists of endemic plants of India. Based on preliminary field observations carried out in the study area, major habitats such as plateaus, moist deciduous forests, semi-evergreen forests, evergreen forests and mangroves were identified for the subsequent intensive survey of endemics. Voucher specimens for all the endemic species were collected, processed using conventional herbarium techniques and deposited in the Herbarium, Department of Botany, Goa University. Species were identified using local and regional floras and their identity was confirmed at various herbaria along the Western Ghats. Data on their life-form types, habitat and phenology was recorded in the field. Phenological observations were made every fortnight. A computerized data base was generated incorporating details on their life-form type, phenology and habitat. Results A floristic survey of endemic plants of the Western Ghats in Goa resulted in the collection of 113 endemic species. Life-form analysis reveals that herbaceous endemics are the most dominant followed by trees, shrubs and climbers. Plateaus in the study area harbour the largest number of endemic species, especially herbs. Endemic trees are distributed in the semi-evergreen and evergreen forests. Endemic species in the study area show different peak and lean seasons of flowering depending on their life-form type, habitat and ecological factors like temperature and rainfall/moisture content in the soil. Main conclusions The plateaus in the northern part of the Western Ghats are unique, being species rich with herbaceous endemics. These ephemerals are closely associated with the rainfall patterns thus; any change of moisture regime over the long-term will have an impact on the distribution of these endemics.",2004-08,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,1227-1237,,8,31,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,life-forms; flowering phenology; endemic; evergreen; India; moist deciduous; plateaus; semi-evergreen; tropics; Western Ghats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dependence of phenological events on abiotic (rainfall and day length) and biotic factors (herbivore abundance/damage) was quantified to discern potential relationships. Leaf flush and flowering were not associated with periods of highest rainfall as might be expected in a dry tropical forest. Rather, these events were highly correlated with day length. We observed that most leaf flush began in March and April, which was several months before the wettest period of the year (August to November). This result is consistent with other studies that show that leaf flush in Plumeria is under photoperiodic control and that the plants initiate growth and reproduction when cloudiness is low and seasonal light availability is greatest. Herbivore damage by caterpillars of the sphinx moth Pseudosphinx tetrio is restricted primarily to the wettest season, consistent with the hypothesis that early leaf flush and reproduction has been selected to avoid herbivory. It is not clear whether photoperiodic control of leaf flush and reproduction serves to maximize seasonal light availability, minimize the impact of herbivores, or both. However, it is clear that peak rainfall is not likely to have been the sole selective factor determining leaf flush and flowering in P. alba.",2007-03,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,195-201,,2,39,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: BLACKWELL PUBLISHING Type: Article",,,,Apocynaceae; Guanica; herbivory; photoperiod; plant-insect interaction; Pseudosphinx tetrio; Puerto Rico; Sphingidae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there were major flowering seasons in November 2002 (20.2%), September 2006 (21%), and October-November 2011 (20.3%). Average monthly fruit production showed a peak at the end of the dry season. Major flowering season seemed to coincide with the period of major El Nino events in November 2002 and September 2006, while others associated with La Nina. This study suggest that phenology and climate change may have implications in designing strategies for collection of seed materials to support the conservation and plantation programs of the Dipterocarps.",2016-10,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,129-141,,2,3,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: JL GUNUNG BATU 05, BOGOR, WEST JAVA, 16610, INDONESIA Publisher: MINISTRY ENVIRONMENT & FORESTRY Type: Article",,,,phenology; climate; Dipterocarpaceae; Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little information, however, in particular from the Southeast Asian tropics, is available on how exactly logging affects wildlife food security. To address the gap, this paper presents the first high-resolution comparison of fruit production between logged and intact forests in lowland Borneo. In the period of 2004-2008, dry weight of fruit litter was assessed as a proxy for food security of wildlife. The pheno-phases of 1,054 trees in 14 sampling plots were monitored for 54 months. A total of 143,184 fruits from 50 tree families were collected from six sampling transects totalling 810 km in 34 months. Surprisingly, logged forest (mean = 23.3 kg ha(-1), SD =48.9) produced more fruit litter than intact forest (mean =16.7 kg ha(-1), SD =23.3), although the difference is not significant based on Student's t test; t(66) = 0.702, p= 0.485. Pheno-phases could not be entirely explained by rainfall and temperature variables. Some evidence, however, indicates tree species composition, stand structure and sunlight exposure were likely determinants of flowering and fruit litter intensity. All things being equal, results imply selective logging if considerately practiced may increase food security for wildlife. The findings, however, should be interpreted with caution since tropical forest phenology and fruit productivity are also driven by a suite of small-scale edaphic attributes and large-scale spatio-temporal meteorological forcing. Although this research deals mainly with Borneo, the principles discussed and insights offered herein are valuable for furthering conversation around sustainable forestry in tropical Asia and elsewhere globally.",2022-04,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,753-767,,4,66,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Phenology; Frugivore; Fruit; Insolation; Meteorology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Question: We investigated whether tree species classified into ecological groups of species of successional status (late-, early-successional tree species) and seed dispersal mode (anemochory, autochory, zoochory) would display different phenological patterns. Study site and dates: A tropical dry forest in eastern Mexico; November 2007 to September 2010. Methods: We monthly recorded leaf fall, leafing, flowering, and fruiting in 165 trees belonging to 16 species tagged along a trail inside a forest fragment (21 ha). Monthly precipitation and temperatures data were obtained from the nearest meteorological station. Phenological periodicity was analyzed using circular statistics. Results: Leaf fall occurred during the dry season and leafing at the beginning of the rainy season. Flowering at community level was not significantly cyclic because of differences within groups: late-successional and zoochorous species displayed a flowering peak during the rainy season, whereas the early-successional, anemochorous and autochorous species do during the dry season. Fruiting occurred over an extended period but showed a cyclic pattern: Late successional and zoochorous species fruited at the beginning of the dry season, whereas early-successional and autochorous species tend to displayed a peak of fruiting at mid-dry season and the anemochorous at the end of the dry season.

Episodic rains significantly increased leaf water potential (from -5 to -2.5 MPa) in several species and, in some cases, triggered flowering, leading us to hypothesize that the coexistence of species with contrasting phenology is due to differences in their ability to utilize small rainfall events. Irrigation treatments were used to simulate brief rainfall events, and the response of three species (Erythrina velutina [deciduous], Croton heliaster [semideciduous], and Capparis odoratissima [evergreen]) was monitored over a period of 14 months. To partition the effects of water reaching the canopy versus the soil, irrigation was supplied either in the form of mist to the canopy or by minisprinklers near the base of the trees. Nonirrigated trees were used as controls. Productivity (estimated as aboveground litter production) and water potential were enhanced by soil irrigation in two species. However, in the evergreen species canopy irrigation had a greater effect on water relations and productivity than soil irrigation, as indicated by higher predawn water potential, higher total annual flower (40 g m(-2) year(-1)) and fruit (5 g m(-2) year(-1)) production, and longer leaf longevity (410 days in control trees versus 520 days in canopy-irrigated trees). Canopy irrigation augmented flower and fruit production in all three species. Our findings suggest that reproductive phenology in these species is driven by episodic rains and that evergreen species may sustain productivity by their ability to make use of water deposited on leaf surfaces.",2005-05,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,336-348,,3,19,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY Publisher: SPRINGER HEIDELBERG Type: Article",,,,phenology; canopy irrigation; foliar water uptake; productivity; very dry forest; water pulses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The period of fruiting in trees and lianas is clearly separated in time. Dispersal by trees is concentrated in “secas”, while dispersal by lianas is more frequent during “nortes.” The fruiting in relation to diaspore type revealed two patterns. Plumed diaspores were more abundant during “secas” independent of life form. In contrast, species with winged diaspores had a bimodal distribution, one during “secas” and the other one during “nortes”, the latter was due primarily to fruiting lianas.",1991-09,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,242-254,,3,23,,,,,,,,,,Spanish,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative assessment was made at 15 day interval for all the phenophases (leaf initiation, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting) by tagging 40 (forty) trees over a period of two years (2012-14). To test seasonal influence on the phenology of Barringtonia acutangula different phenophases were correlated with environmental variables and statistical spearman's rank correlation coefficient was employed. Aridity index was computed that delineate influence of rainfall and temperature together on any phenophases. Leaf initiation showed positively significant correlation with temperature (r(s)=0.601, p=<.05) during the year 2012-2013 whereas it was significantly correlated with rainfall (r(s)=0.583, p=<.05) and aridity index (rs=0.583, p=<.05) during the year 2013-2014.

Based on the well-established relationships of wood density with water-storing capacity and cavitation vulnerability in woody plants, we hypothesized differential vegetative and reproductive phenological responses to environmental cues for hardwood and softwood species. To test this hypothesis, we compared phenological patterns of pairs of conspecific populations of 10 species differing in wood density, occurring in two localities with slightly different climatic regimes, and evaluated the influence of three environmental variables (rainfall, photoperiod, and temperature) on them. Our results, based on the assessment of the overlap of the phenological curves of conspecific populations occurring in different sites and on linear modeling, showed different effects of the environmental factors on phenophase attributes, depending on wood density of the study species, thus supporting our hypothesis. Leaf out in softwood species took place in the dry season, they shed the foliage at the first signs of drought, and once leafless, they flowered and fruited shortly after. By contrast, hardwood species bore leaves and flowers in the rainy season, shed their leaves several months after the rain ceased, and produced fruits during the dry season. We conclude that the role of environmental variables in cueing growth and reproduction cycles in SDTF tree species is interrelated with their wood density, a key endogenous factor crucially linked to plant hydraulics in these water-limited ecosystems.

Differences were found in the climatic response of the species in comparison to studies already performed in the tropics. In this study, on an intra-annual scale, this association is manifested by relationships with photoperiod, being positive for leaf flushing and fruiting and negative for leaf shedding.

The main aims were to investigate how possible environmental cues influence timing and development of phenophases and whether different tree species have different seasonal responses to these cues. Likely effects of climatic changes on phenological development patterns were also considered. All three species studied had generally comparable seasonal responses irrespective of the mean annual rainfall at each site, but differed in the timing of certain phenophases. Both A. erioloba and A. mellifera flowered at the end of the cool dry season. Acacia erioloba produced new leaves simultaneous with flowers while A. mellifera produced fully developed fruits before leaves. On the other hand, A. luederitzii produced leaves and flowered after rain and well into the growing season, with leaves appearing before the flowers. For A. erioloba and A. mellifera, temperature and daylength appeared to be the most probable phenological cues, while in the case of A. leuderitzii, it was rainfall. All species produced lower amounts of certain litter components during the year of lower rainfall at the Tsabong site, affecting fodder availability. Livestock was observed feeding on newly emerged flowers, leaves and new twigs, relieved from scratching the ground for dry grass, fallen leaves and pods. Other studies have also observed new growth to provide valuable fodder in the dry season and drought periods, making phenological timing economically crucial. Any shift in climatic factors that affect this timing may have detrimental consequences. Drought is the best-known example of an extreme shift. There is need for more information on the likely extent of other shifts and possible effects in vulnerable areas such as the Kalahari in the face of changing environmental and climatic conditions.

A significant proportion (15.4%) of the phenotypic variation in flowering initiation day was accounted for by environmental variance. The expression of phenotypic variance of flowering time and, consequently, the opportunity for selection to act, are controlled by annual variation in rainfall.

Flavonoids, compounds known as UV-B protectors, were found in high concentration in leaves of P. quadrijuga. There was a significant positive relationship between monthly rainfall, monthly minimum temperatures and flavonoid concentration, but no relationship was found with leaf age. The annual fine litterfall for the Polylepis forest was estimated to be 3.9 t ha(-1) y(-1), a high value when compared to other paramo and upper montane rain forests in tropical mountains. High production was associated with high leaf nitrogen concentration (3.0-3.5%), high rates of nitrogen retranslocation (80% dry weight), and relatively low leaf longevity (8.4 mo). High production in P. quadrijuga is probably a key factor in explaining the existence of this large woody species in a paramo environment otherwise dominated by bunch grasses, cushion plants and giant rosettes of the genus Espeletia.",1998-11,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,771-787,,6,14,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article",,,,phenology; herbivory; Andes; Colombia; flavonoids; leaf longevity; paramo; phytochemistry; Polylepis; production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to describe flowering patterns for more than 100 species in Tinigua Park, Colombia, and to propose which factors may trigger flower production (e.g., rainfall, temperature, cloud cover, and photoperiod). Data gathered in 5.6 km of phenological transects during 4 yr and complementary information indicated that the vast majority of species showed intraspecific synchronization, and annual production was the most common pattern, followed by episodic frequency. The annual patterns were common in tree species, while episodic patterns were common in lianas. Simple and multiple regression analyses suggested several aspects of photoperiod as the most likely triggers for flowering in most species. However, the fact that many of these species produce flowers in different periods each year, suggests that the proportion of species responding to photoperiodic cues is less that 23 percent in this community. The flowering times of taxonomically related species seldom showed significantly staggered distributions; however they do not necessarily occur at the same time, suggesting that flowering patterns are not strongly constrained by phylogeny.",2008-09,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,559-567,,5,40,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,phenology; photoperiod; flowering frequency; plant habits; proximate factors; Tinigua National Park; tropical seasonal forest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that wood density and related tissue water storage would reliably distinguish phenological groups of trees, and that leaf shedding, flushing, and flowering in high wood density species would be closely related to rainfall, due to low tissue water storage capacity in these species. By contrast, we predicted leaf unfolding and flowering of low wood density species would depend exclusively on photoperiod. As predicted, wood density and saturated water content were inversely correlated, and species with either high or low wood density had distinct phenological patterns and levels of synchrony within species.

Because epiphytes depend on environmental moisture, seasonal changes in moisture conditions likely act as the primary determinants of their reproductive timing. We examined whether water limitation or pollinator competition structures the flowering phenologies of an epiphytic community in a seasonal mountain forest in Costa Rica. Additionally, we addressed the environmental factors that might trigger floral induction. Using a 24-month dataset of bimonthly flowering records from 104 species, we found high seasonality of flowering at the species level but somewhat lower seasonality at the community level. The flowering mid-dates of most epiphytes, particularly from monocotyledonous species, occurred during the wettest months, as predicted if water limitation structures flowering. The increased moisture and nutrient availability during the rainy season give epiphytes the resources needed to complete floral development and anthesis, and later fruit and seed maturation. The observed flowering pattern of epiphytes coincides with reproductive patterns of terrestrial herbs and shrubs from seasonal tropical ecosystems, and suggests shared constraints to sexual reproduction in both ecological guilds under similar climatic conditions. In contrast, flowering patterns of congeneric epiphytes in the same pollination guild mostly did not follow the expectations of a pollinator competition scenario. Finally, we discuss the possible combined effect of precipitation, temperature, and daily insolation on floral induction of epiphytic plants.

The timing of leaf fall in saplings was positively correlated with net radiation, and maximum and minimum temperature, but negatively correlated with relative humidity the preceding month, although these correlations were weak. The leaf production rate was larger under higher light, but the leaf fall rate was not related to the light regime of the saplings. Thus, leaf production was enhanced by the light availability for each individual, while leaf fall may have been enhanced by drought stress. Non-synchronous leaf production appears to be important for sapling growth, allowing saplings to occupy better-lit space quickly. On the other hand, tall trees showed a clear synchronous leaf-fall pattern, with an annual cycle, and no meteorological factors were correlated with the timing of leaf fall. Mature trees of this species produced flowers simultaneously with new leaves, after shedding their leaves.

MethodsQualitative data collection included the presence or absence of flowers and/or fruits of each species, independently of the development phase of their reproductive organs. A Rayleigh test was used to determine if flowering and fructification were seasonal throughout the year and to detect possible significant seasonal patterns. Spearman's rank correlation and Bonferroni correction were used to determine possible correlations between phenological events and rainfall, temperature and photoperiod. ResultsFlowering and fruiting of the woody community showed a low degree of seasonality.

Despite marked seasonality in rainfall, meristem activity occurred throughout the year. Leaves were produced almost continuously during the rainy season, while leaf shedding started early during drought, before changes in soil water content were observed. Phenological activity under drought included flowering and fruiting of leafless trees; bud break and shoot extension took place before the end of the dry season. Low wood density of C. vitifolium stems (0.17 g/cm(3)) and lignotubers (0.14 g/cm(3)) provided water and starch storage needed to support phenological events such as branch extension, leaf flushing, and reproduction during the dry season, and probably also contributed to survival following mechanical damage and fire, typical of early TDF successional stages. Lignotuber water and starch contents showed substantial seasonal variation, declining from the beginning of the dry season to their lowest levels at the time of reproduction and dry-season flushing. Stems progressively replaced lignotubers as main storage organs as tree size increased. Evidence for a role of water stores in buffering daily water deficits was weak. Leaf water potentials remained above - 1.2 MPa and stomatal conductance below 350 mmol/m(2)/s, suggesting that gas exchange during the rainy season was limited to prevent xylem cavitation. Leaf shedding occurred when early-morning and mid-day Psi(L) converged at the rainy - dry season transition, without changes in lignotuber or soil water content, suggesting that leaves of C. vitifolium are closely tuned to atmospheric drought.",2010-01,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,104-111,,1,42,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,dry-season flushing; fire; pioneer species; reserve storage; stem-succulent; stomatal conductance; succession,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The life forms monitored were herbs (including terrestrial orchids), shrubs and small trees. Flowering and fruiting were non-uniform with a dry season flowering peak and wet season fruiting peak. Flowering in the understorey correlated negatively with rainfall. No significant correlation was detected for fruiting. Life forms had flowering and fruiting peaks at different times of the year.",2002-03,12/02/2025 12:52,12/02/2025 12:52,,179-182,,2,11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article",,,,reproductive phenology; India; Western Ghats; evergreen forest; flowering peaks; fruiting peaks; life form; understorey community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
