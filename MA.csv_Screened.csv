Various functional types differ with respect to phenological timing and triggering factors, water relations, extent of deciduousness (similar to leaflessness), etc. Duration of deciduousness in tropical trees (reflecting integrated effect of seasonal drought, tree characteristics and soil moisture conditions) is related to leafing patterns and resource use rates. Vegetative and flowering phenology of trees in dry tropics is primarily affected by the periodicity of rainfall and soil water availability. Occurrence of leaf-flushing as well as flowering during summer in majority of Indian tropical trees, when drought is severe, seems to be a unique adaptation to survive under strongly seasonal climate having a short growth promoting wet period and a long growth constraining dry period. The key phenological themes that need research focus in the dry tropics are: duration of deciduousness, timing of vegetative bud break, leaf strategy, water relations, seasonal flowering types and asynchrony. Analysis of functional types based on the duration of deciduousness and timing of bud break may enable better assessment of future climate change impact.

Of particular concern are tropical biomes, which represent the most biodiverse and imperilled regions of the world. However, compared to temperate floras, we know little about phenological responses of tropical plants because long-term observational datasets from the tropics are sparse. Herbarium specimens have greatly increased our phenological knowledge in temperate regions, but similar data have been underutilized in the tropics and their suitability for this purpose has not been broadly validated. Here, we compare phenological estimates derived from field observational data (i.e. plot surveys) and herbarium specimens at various spatial and taxonomic scales to determine whether specimens can provide accurate estimations of reproductive timing and its spatial variation. Here, we demonstrate that phenological estimates from field observations and herbarium specimens coincide well. Fewer than 5% of the species exhibited significant differences between flowering periods inferred from field observations versus specimens regardless of spatial aggregation. In contrast to studies based on field records, herbarium specimens sampled much larger geographic and climatic ranges, as has been documented previously for temperate plants, and effectively captured phenological responses across varied environments. Synthesis. Herbarium specimens are verified to be a vital resource for closing the gap in our phenological knowledge of tropical systems. Tropical plant reproductive phenology inferred from herbarium records is widely congruent with field observations, suggesting that they can and should be used to investigate phenological variation and their associated environmental cues more broadly across tropical biomes.",2023-02,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,327-337,NA,2,111,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,phenology; Brazil; climate; herbaria; citizen science; field survey; natural history collections; neotropics,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

The capacity for long-term storage of photosynthate appears to override any necessary functional linkage between these two critical aspects of tree phenology. Foliar and reproductive phenology in broadleaf deciduous trees of the temperate zone are only weakly coupled within a growing season, especially in precocious flowering trees that mature their fruits in early summer. In species that fruit in late summer and fall, leaf emergence and flowering can be entrained by shared responses to the progressive warming of early spring but with only limited effect on the timing of fruit maturation. The timing of foliar senescence and fruit maturation is correlated only in fall-fruiting trees but as a common response to fall climate rather than the outcome of foliar retranslocation of resources to developing fruits. The possibility exists that global climate change may disrupt these patterns of foliar and reproductive phenology, but the magnitude of the effect will depend on the poorly studied balance of thermal versus photoperiodic cues for phenological events.",1995-02,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,175-182,NA,2,73,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA Publisher: NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA Type: Article; Proceedings Paper",NA,NA,NA,PHENOLOGY; BUD BURST; GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE; LEAF SENESCENCE; SEED DISPERSAL,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,maybe,Insert Screener Name

The basic hypothesis of process-based phenology models is that spring tree phenology is regulated by temperature and triggered by chilling temperatures during the dormancy period, followed by forcing temperatures during the growth period. That is, trees require cool temperatures during a chilling period to break endodormancy, and then enter the phase of ecodormancy during which the rate of ontogenetic development increases with increasing air temperature. Therefore, insufficient chilling requirements may slow bud growth and consequently delay budburst. Many studies have shown that chilling requirement is at present sufficient to release bud dormancy fully in temperate regions, and thus forcing temperatures play a dominant role in triggering spring tree phenology. To identify differences in mechanisms of spring tree phenology responses to air temperature between the subtropics/tropics and the temperate zone, and their possible effects on future phenological trends under global warming, we used leaf unfolding and flowering data from a tree species of tropical origin, Melia azedarach, and output daily mean air temperature data from a regional climate model (HadGEM3-RA) for the period 1981-2005 at 42 stations in southeastern China to fit unified forcing and chilling phenology models. Then, we selected optimum models for each phenophase at each station. Moreover, we predicted leafing and flowering dates across the research region over 2021-2100 under global climate warming scenarios. The results show a previously unreported phenological phenomenon: chilling will often be insufficient to break bud dormancy in the northern tropical zone and may become a crucial factor limiting leafing and flowering responses to spring warming. However, chilling will still be sufficient to break bud dormancy in the warm temperate zone, and thus may not limit leafing and flowering responses to spring warming there. Consequently, predicted leafing and flowering dates both will be delayed in the northern tropical zone but will advance in the warm temperate zone from 2021 to 2100. In the subtropical zone, the effect of chilling temperature on spring phenology will be reduced gradually from earlier to later phenophases. Thus, predicted leafing and flowering dates show decreased delaying trends and increased advancing trends from earlier to later phenophases in the subtropical zone. Our findings suggest that insufficient chilling temperature accumulation during the dormancy period may counteract the forcing temperature accumulation during the growth period in the northern tropical zone and parts of the subtropical zone, resulting in delayed leafing and flowering dates.

However, in recent years, accumulating evidence has suggested that tropical forests vary widely both in climate and phenology, that climate and phenology are inextricably linked, and that tropical forests increasingly display the effects of climate change. It is critically important to understand these climate-phenology interactions to be able to predict the cascading impacts on resource availability that will affect wildlife. There are many important and unanswered questions regarding how the mechanistic drivers and proximate cues of tropical forest reproductive phenology will vary in response to environmental change. Addressing these questions remains a huge challenge due to a paucity of long-term comparable data that hampers our ability to connect observed phenology patterns with fundamental theory. In this review, we highlight ten focal papers that have advanced our ability to identify phenological patterns, improved our understanding of the drivers of flowering and fruiting, and have innovatively linked fruiting patterns with impacts on wildlife diet, reproduction, and survival.

Phenological patterns are most diverse and least understood in the tropics. In those parts of tropical Asia where low temperature or drought impose a seasonal rest period, regular annual cycles of growth and reproduction predominate at the individual, population, and community level. In aseasonal areas, individuals and populations show a range of sub- to supra-annual periodicities, with an overall supra-annual reproductive periodicity at the community level. There is no evidence for photoperiod control of phenology in the Asian tropics, and seasonal changes in temperature are a likely factor only near the northern margins. An opportunistic response to water availability is the simplest explanation for most observed patterns where water is seasonally limiting, while the great diversity of phenological patterns in the aseasonal tropics suggests an equal diversity of controls. The robustness of current phenological patterns to high interannual and spatial variability suggests that most plant species will not be seriously affected by the phenological consequences alone of climate change. However, some individual plant species may suffer, and the consequences of changes in plant phenology for flower- and fruit-dependent animals in fragmented forests could be serious.",1998-07,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,439-453,NA,02-Mar,39,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Backup Publisher: World Wildlife Fund; Int Inst Trop Forestry Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Proceedings Paper",NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,maybe? ,Insert Screener Name

We found that, although the drought increased fruiting activity in the community relative to the reference plot, species-level response was varied in both phenology and physiology. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity and occurrence of drought in tropical regions, potentially affecting the phenology and physiology of tree species. Phenological activity may respond to a drying and warming environment by advancing reproductive timing and/or diminishing the production of flowers and fruits. These changes have the potential to disrupt important ecological processes, with potentially wide-ranging effects on tropical forest function. Here, we analysed the monthly flowering and fruiting phenology of a tree community (337 individuals from 30 species) over 7 years in a lowland tropical rainforest in northeastern Australia and its response to a throughfall exclusion drought experiment (TFE) that was carried out from 2016 to 2018 (3 years), excluding approximately 30% of rainfall. We further examined the ecophysiological effects of the TFE on the elemental (C:N) and stable isotope (& delta;13C and & delta;15N) composition of leaves, and on the stable isotope composition (& delta;13C and & delta;18O) of stem wood of four tree species. At the community level, there was no detectable effect of the TFE on flowering activity overall, but there was a significant effect recorded on fruiting and varying responses from the selected species. The reproductive phenology and physiology of the four species examined in detail were largely resistant to impacts of the TFE treatment. One canopy species in the TFE significantly increased in fruiting and flowering activity, whereas one understory species decreased significantly in both. There was a significant interaction between the TFE treatment and season on leaf C:N for two species. Stable isotope responses were also variable among species, indicating species-specific responses to the TFE. Thus, we did not observe consistent patterns in physiological and phenological changes in the tree community within the 3 years of TFE treatment examined in this study.",01/01/2023,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,1,11,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,flowering; drought; Climate change; fruiting; stable isotopes; water use efficiency; Wet Tropics,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

However, we understand much less about climate-driven changes in phenology within subtropical and tropical regions, where the timing of events is less predictable and has not been well-studied. It is not known whether subtropical plants have a similar winter chilling requirement to what has been well-documented in temperate species. To explore this possibility, we established a climate chamber experiment to test the effects of photoperiod and chilling on the timing of budburst within 37 subtropical woody species. We found that both moderate and strong chilling treatments advanced budburst and reduced forcing requirements, relative to plants subjected to a low chilling treatment. Longer photoperiod enhanced budburst rate for only two species, suggesting that chilling is more important for regulating budburst for most species. With respect to future climate change, the spring phenology of subtropical species is expected to be delayed further because species could lack the ability to meet their fundamental chilling requirement.

Little is known, however, about certain critical phenological events, nor about mechanistic links between shifts in different life-history stages of the same organism. Among angiosperms, flowering times have been observed to advance with climate change, but, whether fruiting times shift as a direct consequence of shifting flowering times, or respond differently or not at all to climate change, is poorly understood. Yet, shifts in fruiting could alter species interactions, including by disrupting seed dispersal mutualisms. In the absence of long-term data on fruiting phenology, but given extensive data on flowering, we argue that an understanding of whether flowering and fruiting are tightly linked or respond independently to environmental change can significantly advance our understanding of how fruiting phenologies will respond to warming climates. Through a case study of biotically and abiotically dispersed plants, we present evidence for a potential functional link between the timing of flowering and fruiting. We then propose general mechanisms for how flowering and fruiting life history stages could be functionally linked or independently driven by external factors, and we use our case study species and phenological responses to distinguish among proposed mechanisms in a real-world framework. Finally, we identify research directions that could elucidate which of these mechanisms drive the timing between subsequent life stages. Understanding how fruiting phenology is altered by climate change is essential for all plant species but is particularly critical to sustaining the large numbers of plant species that rely on animal-mediated dispersal, as well as the animals that rely on fruit for sustenance.",06/12/2021,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,,9,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,flowering; fruiting; seed dispersal; global change; life history stages; phenological shifts,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,maybe,Insert Screener Name

Extensive and long-term phenological observations in the tropics are rare and difficult to realise but unpublished historical records have been preserved and are of high value. Phenological data gathered between 1948 and 1957 on 3642 trees of 158 species in the rainforest reserve of Luki, Democratic Republic of Congo were analysed. Patterns of leaf shedding, flowering, fruiting and fruit dispersal were presented for three major functional groups of trees and their relationships with rainfall investigated. Annual rhythms of leaf and reproductive phenology were observed with patterns ranging from synchronous annual peaks to continuity. Over the years, positive association was found between leaf shedding and annual rainfall for shade-tolerant canopy species as well as between reproductive phenology and annual rainfall for long-lived heliophilous and shade-tolerant understorey species. Direct and indirect associations with intra-annual and supra-annual climate variations suggest that changes in environmental conditions may affect phenological patterns of tropical trees thus species interactions and ecosystem dynamics. The different leaf and reproductive phenological patterns found in different functional groups of trees promote the coexistence of numerous tree species in tropical rainforest multispecies communities.

This increase can alter forest structure and decrease both carbon storage and tree diversity via antagonistic relationships between lianas and their host trees. Climate change is postulated as an underlying driver of increasing liana abundances, via increases in dry-season length, forest-disturbance events, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations; all factors thought to favour lianas. However, the impact of climate change on liana reproductive phenology, an underlying determinant of liana abundance, has been little studied, particularly outside of Neotropical forests. Over a 15-year period (2000-2014), we examined the phenological patterns of a liana community in intact rainforests of the Wet Tropics bioregion of Australia; a World Heritage Area and hotspot of floral diversity. Specifically, we assessed (1) flowering and fruiting patterns of liana species; (2) potential climate drivers of flowering and fruiting activity; and (3) the influence of El Nino-related climatic disturbances on liana phenology. We found that flowering and fruiting of the studied liana species increased over time. Liana reproduction, moreover, rose in apparent response to higher temperatures and reduced rainfall. Finally, we found flowering and fruiting of the liana species increased following El Nino events. These results suggest that liana reproduction and abundance are likely to increase under predicted future climate regimes, with potentially important impacts on the survival, growth, and reproduction of resident trees and thus the overall health of Australian tropical rainforests.",09/06/2022,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,,5,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,flowering; fruiting; ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation); forest disturbance; rainforest; woody vines,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,maybe,Insert Screener Name

These differences have resulted in long-term changes in flowering synchrony that may alter the quantity and diversity of pollinator attention to many species, as well as altering food availability to pollenivorous and nectarivorous animal species. However, long-term multi-season records of past flowering timing have primarily focused on temperate environments. In contrast, changes in flowering phenology within humid subtropical environments such as the southeastern USA remain poorly documented. This research uses herbarium-based methods to examine changes in flowering time across 19,328 samples of spring-, summer-, and autumn-flowering plants in the southeastern USA from the years 1951 to 2009. In this study, species that flower near the onset of the growing season were found to advance under increasing mean March temperatures (-3.391 days/A degrees C, p = 0.022). No long-term advances in early spring flowering or spring temperature were detected during this period, corroborating previous phenological assessments for the southeastern USA. However, late spring through mid-summer flowering exhibited delays in response to higher February temperatures (over 0.1.85 days/A degrees C, p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.041 in all cases).

Laboratory experiments using twig cuttings from woody plant species present an affordable, easily replicated approach to investigate the relative importance of factors such as winter chilling, photoperiod, spring warming and frost tolerance on the leafing-out times of plant communities. This Viewpoint article demonstrates how the results of these experiments deepen our understanding beyond what is possible via analyses of remote sensing and field observation data, and can be used to improve climate change forecasts of shifts in phenology, ecosystem processes and ecological interactions. Scope The twig method involves cutting dormant twigs from trees, shrubs and vines on a single date or at intervals over the course of the winter and early spring, placing them in containers of water in controlled environments, and regularly recording leaf-out, flowering or other phenomena. Prior to or following leaf-out or flowering, twigs may be assigned to treatment groups for experiments involving temperature, photoperiod, frost, humidity and more. Recent studies using these methods have shown that winter chilling requirements and spring warming strongly affect leaf-out and flowering times of temperate trees and shrubs, whereas photoperiod requirements are less important than previously thought for most species. Invasive plant species have weaker winter chilling requirements than native species in temperate ecosystems, and species that leaf-out early in the season have greater frost tolerance than later leafing species. Conclusions This methodology could be extended to investigate additional drivers of leaf-out phenology, leaf senescence in the autumn, and other phenomena, and could be a useful tool for education and outreach. Additional ecosystems, such as boreal, southern hemisphere and sub-tropical forests, could also be investigated using dormant twigs to determine the drivers of leaf-out times and how these ecosystems will be affected by climate change.",2015-11,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,889-897,NA,"6, SI",116,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Editorial Material",NA,NA,NA,climate change; phenology; photoperiod; trees; flowering time; Dormant twigs; frost tolerance; humidity; invasive species; leaf-out; shrubs; winter chilling; woody plants,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,not tropical ,Insert Screener Name

Comparisons of expression dynamics of genes studied indicated functional conservation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and LEAFY (LFY) in Shorea. The genes were highly expressed at least 1month before anthesis for both species. A mathematical model considering the synergistic effect of cool temperature and drought on activation of the flowering gene was successful in predicting the observed gene expression patterns. Requirement of both cool temperature and drought for floral transition suggested by the model implies that flowering phenologies of these species are sensitive to climate change.

In tropical forests, studies that document epiphyte reproductive phenology are relatively few because of the challenges of tracking plants that live in the canopy. Phenological patterns for 279 individuals of 7 epiphyte species were examined across 12 months in a tropical montane forest in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Epiphytes were located in one of two common tree species, Ficus tuerckheimii (Moraceae) or Ocotea tonduzii (Lauraceae). Flowering and fruiting (i.e., when ripe or unripe fruit is present on the plant) of study plants was recorded on monthly intervals, and phenology was examined as a function of the season at the study site (i.e., wet, transition, or dry season), and pollinator syndrome (bird-, or insect-pollinated) and seed dispersal syndrome (bird-, bat-, or wind-dispersed) of each plant. Though some epiphyte species flowered and fruited throughout the year, the majority showed significant seasonality in phenological events. Based on circular statistics, the timing of mean flowering of different epiphyte species varied, however, timing of mean fruiting for most species tended to occur during the wet season. Insect- and bird-pollinated species had peak flowering during the dry season and late wet season, respectively. Bird-dispersed fruits were present each month of the year with peaks from February to October and again in December. Wind-dispersed fruits were observed eight months of the year with a peak in the early wet season. The timing of epiphyte flowering coincided with flowering of large trees in the area. Epiphyte fruiting, however, is distinct from large tree fruiting.

To date, the relative importance of winter chilling and photoperiod for leaf-out and flowering phenology remains unknown in subtropical and tropical forests. Here, we established a climate chamber experiment to test the effects of photoperiod and chilling on the timing of leaf-out and flowering for 37 subtropical woody species using dormant twigs. We found that most cuttings reached leaf-out, but only a few cuttings reached flowering. Longer chilling (including both moderate and strong chilling treatments) may improve leaf-out success and advance leaf-out timing, but it showed little effect on flowering. Moderate chilling was enough for the initiation of leaf-out. Photoperiod showed little effect on both leaf-out and flowering. To our knowledge, our study is the first to explore how different winter chilling conditions may lead to tree phenology progressing in various subtropical species in a new order and to show that leaf-out order is largely unpredictable when chilling requirements are not met. Our experiment indicates that dormant twigs of subtropical woody species can be successfully applied to leaf-out rather than flowering. Our results suggest that lack of chilling not only led to a considerable delay in leaf-out for subtropical species, but it also caused substantial changes in the order of species leaf-out.

The timing of reproductive primordia, buds, flowers, fruit and propagule fall did not differ significantly over the latitudinal range of the study. Peak propagule fall occurred in April after a mean 19-20 months of development, only slightly longer than accounts for tropical latitudes. On average, 2.1% of buds matured to form viable propagules, with an average of 17.2% of buds becoming advanced fruit and 11.9% of advanced fruit becoming mature propagules, which compares well with the ranges published accounts for Australian tropical R. stylosa trees. However, there were relatively few buds per inflorescence on recorded shoots in this study, although formal studies on this in the tropics are absent. Within-site variation in bud and propagule production per shoot was greater than variability between sites in many cases, though our sample size was necessarily low due to the rarity of the trees at the southern limit and the detailed recording method. The species reproduces successfully at its known southern limit, with notable comparability to the eastern Australian Tropics.

We also found that flowering and fruiting occurrence were related to local climatic conditions from months prior to the collections. We found marked phenological variations over the decades and also that these variations are associated to global climate change, adding up to the large body of evidence from higher latitudes. Our results also support herbarium collections as an important source for long-term tropical phenological studies. The lack of consistent patterns of responses among the four species (e.g. fruiting delayed two months in P. clavatum and advanced one month in M. acutiflora) suggests that climate change has unequal effects across tropical forests. This highlights the urgent need for further research to understand and forecast the ecological implications of these changes in global ecosystems processes.",07/05/2021,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,5,16,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA Publisher: PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

However, phenology data sets spanning many years are rare in the tropics, making it difficult to evaluate possible responses of tropical communities to climate change. Here we use two data sets (1970-1983 and 1990-2002) to describe the fruiting patterns of the tropical tree community in Kibate National Park, Uganda. To address variation in spatial patterns, we describe fruiting over 2-3 y among four sites each separated by 12-15 km. Presently, the Kibale region is receiving c. 300 min more rain than it did at the start of the century, droughts are less frequent, the onset of the rainy season is earlier. and the average maximum monthly temperature is 3.5degreesC hotter than it was 25 y ago. The 1990-2002 phenology data illustrated high temporal variability in the proportion of the populations fruiting. Interannual variation in community-wide fruit availability was also high; however, the proportion of trees that fruited has increased over the past 12 + y. At the species level a variety of patterns were exhibited; however, a number of the most common species currently rarely fruit, and when they do, typically < 41% of the individuals take part in fruiting events. Combining the data set from 1990 to 2002 with that from 1970 to 1983 for specific species again reveals an increase in the proportion of trees fruiting between 1990 and 2002: however, the proportion of the populations fruiting decreased during the earlier period. When one examines particular species over this whole period a variety of patterns are evident. For example, Pouteria altissima exhibited a relatively regular pattern of fruiting during the 1970s; however, it rarely fruited in the 1990s. Contrasting phenological patterns at four sites revealed that at the community level the fruiting patterns of only one of the six pair-wise site combinations were correlated. Relationships between rainfall and fruiting were variable among sites. Contrasting changes in fruiting patterns over the 30 y with differences among the four sites varying in rainfall, suggests that the changes observed in fruiting may be due to climate change. Responses to this climate change are likely complex and will vary among species. However, for some species, current conditions appear unsuitable for fruiting.",2005-01,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,31-45,NA,1,21,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,climate change; seasonality; flowering; fruiting; tropical trees; Kibale National Park; phenology; seed dispersal; Uganda,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,fruiting not flowering ,Insert Screener Name

In contrast, plants growing in wet tropical forests are freed from many abiotic constraints, which in canopy tree communities lead to a rich diversity of phenological patterns within and among individuals, species and communities. However, basic descriptions of tropical phenological patterns and the processes that shape them are rare. Here, we document the individual-, population-, and landscape-level phenological patterns of two dominant families of understory woody plants important to avian frugivores, the Melastomataceae and Rubiaceae, along an elevational transect in Costa Rica. The 226 individual plants belonging to 35 species in this study, varied in the number of reproductive bouts/year, and the timing, duration, and synchrony of reproductive stages. This variation was not related to factors related to their interactions with mutualists and antagonists, nor did it appear to be constrained by phylogeny. Diverse phenological patterns among species led to relatively aseasonal patterns at the community and landscape level. Overall, evidence for biotic processes shaping temporal patterns of fruiting phenology was weak or absent. These findings reveal a number of unexplained patterns, and suggest that factors shaping phenology in relatively aseasonal forests operate in idiosyncratic ways at the species level. Rev. Biol.

In turn, many of these fauna are dependent on the flowering phenology of the plant species of such ecosystems. The impact of changes in climate, including climate extremes, on the interaction between these fauna and flora has not been identified or elucidated, yet influences on flowering phenology are already evident. These changes are well documented in the mid to high latitudes. However, there is emerging evidence that the flowering phenology, nectar/pollen production, and fruit production of long-lived trees in tropical and subtropical forests are also being impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of climate extremes. Here, we examine the implications of these changes for vertebrate fauna dependent on these resources. We review the literature to establish evidence for links between climate extremes and flowering phenology, elucidating the nature of relationships between different vertebrate taxa and flowering regimes. We combine this information with climate change projections to postulate about the likely impacts on nectar, pollen and fruit resource availability and the consequences for dependent vertebrate fauna. The most recent climate projections show that the frequency and intensity of climate extremes will increase during the 21st century. These changes are likely to significantly alter mass flowering and fruiting events in the tropics and subtropics, which are frequently cued by climate extremes, such as intensive rainfall events or rapid temperature shifts. We find that in these systems the abundance and duration of resource availability for vertebrate fauna is likely to fluctuate, and the time intervals between episodes of high resource availability to increase. The combined impact of these changes has the potential to result in cascading effects on ecosystems through changes in pollinator and seed dispersal ecology, and demands a focused research effort.",2015-09,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,3267-3277,NA,9,21,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Review",NA,NA,NA,flowering; fruiting; climate extremes; ecosystem processes; extreme climate events; frugivores; nectarivores; tree reproductive phenology; vertebrate species,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,maybe,Insert Screener Name

We explored phenological patterns in Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park (HNNP) in China and their major climatic and biotic drivers, based on phenological and distribution data for >2000 species from the Flora of Hainan. Specifically, we address the following questions: (1) What are the phenological patterns for all species in HNNP and for Hainan gibbon food plants only? (2) What are the environmental drivers of reproductive phenology? (3) Whether the flowering and fruiting dates are phylogenetic conserved? (4) Does reproductive phenology vary with functional groups, like growth forms, pollination modes and fruit types? Our results show flowering peaks in late spring and early summer, while fruiting phenology was concentrated during late summer and fall. Closely related species tend to have similar flowering and fruiting dates. The number of flowering species was primary controlled by mean maximum monthly temperature while minimum monthly temperature was the most important variable in shaping fruiting patterns of all species. For fruiting of gibbon food plants, mean monthly precipitation was the most important variable. Our study found January to May was food shortage period, which has important implications for Hainan gibbon conservation. We should take targeted ecological restoration by planting gibbon food species with phenologies between January and May, and take targeted provisioning to attract gibbons into a new habitat by providing fruits between January and May.

However, detecting the respective influence of these variables is difficult due to the relatively small range of change that is observed in the tropics. Analysis is further constrained by the limited duration of many phenological datasets. To address these limitations, we developed a predictive ecoinformatic model using multivariate linear regression and slope correlation analysis that can uncover statistically significant biological responses within short, noisy ecological time series. Our approach correlates all possible combinations of climatic and taxonomic variables using a series of random determination trials on shuffled environmental data. Seasonal and annual fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, and sunlight were used to predict the reproductive response of each individual taxon. This predictive model was applied to two seasonally sampled aerial pollen records collected between 1996 and 2006 from two Panamanian forests, Barro Colorado Island and Parque Nacional San Lorenzo. Our results highlight the degree to which pollen output responds to fine-scale variability in climate. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that the pollen output of tropical species is diminished with prolonged periods of heavy rainfall and that pollen output is sensitive to small, seasonal increases in temperature.

However, effective monitoring of flowering over various scales from individuals to forest ecosystem levels is lacking due to the relatively small sizes of flowers, diverse flowering strategies across species, and the short duration of flowering, making accurate flower detection difficult. Dronebased surveys require less time and human resources than traditional ground-based flower surveys and thus may be able to help address this in a cost-effective manner but remain underexplored in species-rich tropical forest ecosystems. Here, we developed a method that integrated the Residual Networks 50 (ResNet50) deep learning algorithm with high resolution imagery (c. 0.05 m) from monthly drone surveys done in a 50-ha tropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panam & PRIME;a, over 2018-2020 to detect a diversity of flowering species in this tree community and to track the timing of flowering throughout the year. We built a comprehensive training library of canopy components (flower, leaf, branch, and shade) from this forest plot throughout the study period, trained a single deep learning model across all drone imagery, and validated it using five-fold cross validation at the pixel scale. We further generated image- and tree-crown-specific supervised classifications to evaluate the deep learning model at the tree-crown scale. Our deep learning method accurately classified flowers (User's accuracy = 95.3 %, Producer's accuracy = 85.8 %) while maintaining high predictive power for the other three classes (Overall accuracy = 98.4 %). Our results also demonstrated high consistency against tree-crown-specific supervised classifications for flower (r2 = 0.85), leaf (r2 = 0.84), and branch (r2 = 0.92) components, with lower agreement observed for the shade component (r2 = 0.59). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in advancing fine-scale flower monitoring in the tropics, with potential to be extended to other regions or other remote sensing platforms with frequent high-resolution monitoring.

Anomalously warm equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures affect rainfall and temperature throughout the tropics and coincide with altered leaf flush phenology and increased fruit production in wet tropical forests; however, the understanding of mechanisms underlying this pattern is limited. There is evidence that increases in tropical tree reproduction anticipate El Nino onset, motivating the continued search for a global driver of tropical angiosperm reproduction. We present the solar-wind energy flux hypothesis: that physical energy influx to the Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere, generated by a positive anomaly in the solar wind preceding El Nino development, cues tropical trees to increase resource allocation to reproduction. Methods We test this hypothesis using 19 years of data from Luquillo, Puerto Rico, correlating them with measures of solar-wind energy. Results From 1994 to 2013, the solar-wind energy flux into Earth's magnetosphere (E-in) was more strongly correlated with the number of species fruiting and flowering than the Nino 3.4 climate index, despite Nino 3.4 being previously identified as a driver of interannual increases in reproduction. Conclusions Changes in the global magnetosphere and thermosphere conditions from increased solar-wind energy affect global atmospheric pressure and circulation patterns, principally by weakening the Walker circulation. We discuss the idea that these changes cue interannual increases in tropical tree reproduction and act through an unidentified mechanism that anticipates and synchronizes the reproductive output of the tropical trees with El Nino.",2019-11,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,1519-1525,NA,11,106,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,flowering; reproductive phenology; fruiting; tropical trees; El Nino Southern Oscillation; Luquillo; solar wind; solar-wind energy flux,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,maybe,Insert Screener Name

We collected data on growth phenology of about 400 perennial herbs in a botanical garden to make the results independent of local differences in climatic drivers as much as possible. Using these data, we determined species-specific parameters of Day of peak growth, Day of maturity and two types of growth rates associated with the change in plant size. Environmental conditions in which these species occur in the field were assessed using Ellenberg indicator values, which express species' optima along gradients of moisture, nutrients and temperature. 3. Both timing and speed of growth estimated in the common garden were affected by light and moisture conditions of the habitats where the species typically occur. All parameters showed phylogenetic conservatism. 4. We identified two relationships among these parameters of growth phenology: (1) species with early peak growth had high relative growth rates in contrast to late species; (2) tall species showed later peak growth than short species. The first relationship is associated with survival under forest canopy, where species are selected to grow early and fast before trees leaf out, which restricts their size. The latter is associated with (asymmetric) competition for light in open habitats, where the main selection factor is for tall stature, which cannot be attained early in the season. 5. Synthesis. We show that large differences in size growth dynamics among herbaceous species are constrained by a few key trade-offs involving height at maturity, rate of growth and time when maximum height is attained. These trade-offs correspond to major selective forces acting on herbaceous plants in temperate climates.",2018-07,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,1621-1633,NA,4,106,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,flowering phenology; Day of peak growth; Ellenberg values; growth phenology; growth rate; light; nutrients; perennial plant; phylogenetic conservatism,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,not tropical,Insert Screener Name

Yet, the phenological responses of tropical plants to climate change are still unclear. In this study, temporal trends (1973-1999) of four phenological events (budburst, growing season, flowering and flowering duration) were studied among 21 plant species in Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (south-western China). Fourteen species (67%) showed significant phenological trends during the study period. Seven species (33%) presented delaying trends in budburst (average 1.4 d y(-1)) and such trend was more likely to be presented in those that started budburst earlier in the dry season. Four species (19%) showed trends of extension in growing season (average of 3.5 d y(-1)). These vegetative events appeared to be mainly influenced by increasing temperature. Rainfall showed little effects directly, however, the effects of temperature seemed to largely depend on the moisture condition. Flowering duration of five species (24%) was shortened by average 2.1 d y(-1) which was most likely to be the result of the decline in sunshine duration during the rainy season.

Urban land use and its resulting microclimates work in conjunction with the impacts of climate change. Among the principal environmental signals that modulate bud flush, only temperature has changed significantly in recent years. Throughout South Korea, abnormal shoots (usually known as lammas shoots) in Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora), which were once a rare phenomenon, have become notably more common in recent years. The phenomenon is prominent in urban site of each local area. These abnormal shoots appear at a higher frequency and grow to longer lengths in Seoul's hotter urban center than in suburban sites and showed a close positive correlation with urban density and a close negative correlation with vegetation cover expressed as NDVI. Differences in temperature among the urban center, urban edge, and suburban greenbelt were significantly correlated with land-use intensity. Korean red pines planted in urban parks at sites in urban centers showed a lower frequency of abnormal shoots, and the length of the shoots was shorter, compared with those at the other urban sites. Furthermore, the phenology of Korean red pines in an urban park with a fountain showed a spatial difference, depending upon the distance from the fountain: pine trees close to the fountain did not produce abnormal shoots, but abnormal shoot growth increased with the distance from the fountain. These results are noteworthy because they are related to the cooling effects of evapotranspiration from vegetated landscapes and evaporation from a water body. From the results of this study, we could confirm that microclimate change due to urbanization accelerates the impacts of climate change on plant phenology. Furthermore, we identified the possibility that judicious land-use planning could contribute to minimizing the adverse effects of climate change.",2020-04,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,571-584,NA,4,64,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,Climate change; Urbanization; Abnormal growth; Korean red pine; Land use pattern,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,not tropical,Insert Screener Name

At the community level, bimodal fruiting pattern prevailed, with a major peak in the dry season and a minor one in the early rainy season. An annual fruiting pattern was observed in many species and among the studied species fruiting lasted for 2-9 months. There was no significant difference in the frequency of species at three fruiting stages across the life-form categories and many species of upper and lower canopy trees and lianas were in the ripe fruiting phase during the late dry season. Plant physiognomic groups displayed distinct seasonality in fruiting pattern. The fruit maturation period was much longer for the wet season fruiting brevideciduous species than evergreen and deciduous species that fruited during the dry season. The variation in timing of fruiting behaviour among zoochorous species demonstrated less seasonality and zoochorous fruits were available throughout the year. Fruiting in anemochorous species peaked during the driest months and dryness favoured the dissemination of seeds.

Here, we recorded the vegetative and reproductive phenodynamics of 479 individuals belonging to 182 tree species monthly over two years in a lowland Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil, and assessed the relationship between local climatic conditions and the occurrence and intensity of phenophases. We found a constant but low intensity of occurrence of both leaf fall and leaf flush with respect to canopy cover, resulting in an evergreen cover throughout the year. The timing of the reproductive phenophases was irregular between the two years of observation, and their amplitude was low. In addition, flowering and fruiting phenograms of activity, intensity and intensity corrected by the basal area did not overlap. These results suggest that a combination of phenological records and community-structure parameters allows for the obtainment of more accurate estimates of resource availability over time. We found that differences in growing degree-days (GDD), photoperiod and precipitation over time were related to temporal variation in leaf fall, leaf flush and flowering, with a large consistency in responses across tree species in this lowland Atlantic Forest. Moreover, there was only a weak relationship between climatic conditions and the dynamics of fruit formation and ripening, which were more strongly related to flowering phenodynamics, which is suggestive of indirect effects of climatic conditions on fruiting. Finally, the association we found between the number of days with precipitation and leaf fall dynamics agrees with the view that the greater potential for extreme events may impair plant growth in tropical forests. This reinforces the growing concerns regarding the risk of ecological collapse of tropical forests due to fragmentation and global climate change.",2018-03,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,3,9,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,climate change; tropical forest; community ecology; global vegetation models; phenological intensity,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Fewer studies, however, have focused on long-term trends in reproductive activity, in part because of the lack of data from tropical sites. Here, we analyze a 28-year record of tropical flower phenology in response to anthropogenic climate and atmospheric change. We show that a multidecadal increase in flower activity is most strongly associated with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations using yearly aggregated data. Compared to significant climatic factors, CO2 had on average an approximately three-, four-, or fivefold stronger effect than rainfall, solar radiation, and the Multivariate ENSO Index, respectively. Peaks in flower activity were associated with greater solar radiation and lower rainfall during El Nino years. The effect of atmospheric CO2 on flowering has diminished over the most recent decade for lianas and canopy trees, whereas flowering of midstory trees and shrub species continued to increase with rising CO2. Increases in flowering were accompanied by a lengthening of flowering duration for canopy and midstory trees. Understory treelets did not show increases in flowering but did show increases in duration. Given that atmospheric CO2 will likely continue to climb over the next century, a long-term increase in flowering activity may persist in some growth forms until checked by nutrient limitation or by climate change through rising temperatures, increasing drought frequency and/or increasing cloudiness and reduced insolation.",2018-05,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,2105-2116,NA,5,24,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,climate change; solar irradiance; solar radiation; reproduction; CO2 fertilization; El Nino; lifeforms,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Forty years ago, a tree physiological research tradition in aboveground and belowground resource capture was established with questions and methods on climate-tree-soil-crop interactions in space and time that are still relevant for today's challenges. After summarising early research contributions, we review recent literature to assess current levels of uncertainty in climate adaptation assessments in and through AF. Quantification of microclimate within and around tree canopies showed a gap between standard climate station data (designed to avoid tree influences) and the actual climate in which crop and tree meristems or livestock operates in real-world AF. Where global scenario modelling of `macroclimate' change in mean annual rainfall and temperature extrapolates from climate station conditions in past decades, it ignores microclimate effects of trees. There still is a shortage of long-term phenology records to analyse tree biological responses across a wide range of species to climate variability, especially where flowering and pollination matter.

We evaluated a 15-year dataset of tree phenology in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to identify abiotic predictors of fruit phenological patterns and discuss our findings in light of climate change. We quantified fruiting for 326 trees from 43 species and evaluated these patterns in relation to solar radiance, rainfall, and monthly temperature. We used time-lagged variables based on seasonality in linear regression models to assess the effect of abiotic variables on the proportion of fruiting trees. Annual fruiting varied over 3.8-fold, and inter-annual variation in fruiting is associated with the extent of fruiting in the peak period, not variation in time of fruit set. While temperature and rainfall showed positive effects on fruiting, solar radiance in thetwo-year period encompassing a given year and the previous year was the strongest predictor of fruiting. As solar irradiance was the strongest predictor of fruiting, the projected increase in rainfall associated with climate change, and coincident increase in cloud cover suggest that climate change will lead to a decrease in fruiting. ENSO in the prior 24-month period was also significantly associated with annual ripe fruit production, and ENSO is also affected by climate change.

The present work aims to document the phenological diversity of flowering and fruiting with reference to leafing events in Indian dry-tropical tree species. Methods Nine tree species, including one leaf-exchanging and eight deciduous showing varying leafless periods, were studied. Monthly counts of leaves, flowers and fruits were made on 160 tagged twigs on ten individuals of each species for initiation, completion and duration of different phenological events through two annual cycles. Key Results Variation in flowering relative to leaf flushing (which occurred just prior to or during a hot, dry summer) revealed five flowering types: summer flowering (on foliated shoots), rainy-season flowering (on foliated shoots following significant rains), autumn flowering (on shoots with mature leaves), winter flowering (on shoots undergoing leaf fall) and dry-season flowering (on leafless shoots). Duration of the fruiting phenophase was shortest (3-4 months) in dry-season and winter-flowering species, 6-9 months in rainy-and autumn-flowering species, and maximum (11 months) in summer-flowering species. A wide range of time lag (< 1 to > 8 months) between the start of vegetative (first-leaf flush) and reproductive (first-visible flower) phases was recorded in deciduous species; this time lag was correlated with the extent of the leafless period. A synthesis of available phenological information on 119 Indian tropical trees showed that summer-flowering species were most abundant (56% of total species) amongst the five types recognized. Conclusions The wide diversity of seasonal flowering and fruiting with linkages to leaf flush time and leafless period reflect the fact that variable reproductive and survival strategies evolved in tree species under a monsoonic bioclimate. Flowering periodicity has evolved as an adaptation to an annual leafless period and the time required for the fruit to develop. The direct relationship between leafless period (inverse of growing period) and time lag between onset of vegetative and reproductive phases reflects the partitioning of resource use for supporting these phases. Predominance of summer flowering coupled with summer leaf flushing seems to be a unique adaptation in trees to survive under a strongly seasonal tropical climate.",2006-02,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,265-276,NA,2,97,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,flowering types; fruiting; tropical tree phenology; asynchrony; leafless period; semi-evergreen species; summer flowering; summer leaf flushing,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

We measured stem diameter increment using band dendrometers and visually assessed leaf and reproductive phenology monthly from 1997 to 2000. We categorized the species into groups based on patterns of leaf exchange and reproduction. Species were either deciduous with synchronous or asynchronous leaf drop, or evergreen with continuous or seasonal leaf flushing. Flowering occurred supra-annually, annually, or continuously. Of the ten species studied, four species, Cecropia insignis, Dipteryx panamensis, Lecythis ampla, and Simarouba amara, had consistent seasonal stem diameter increment patterns in both years. Dipteryx panamensis and L. ampla were deciduous with synchronized leaf drop. Cecropia insignis was evergreen and produced new leaves continuously. Simarouba amara, also evergreen, exchanged leaves over a brief period once a year. We tested whether stem diameter increment was correlated to phenology using logistic regression.

In this article, the impacts of this drought on the rain forest at Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, are considered with special reference to a keystone plant group, the figs. Small fires entered the edge of the forest from the roadside, killing saplings, climbers, and understory trees. Community-wide mortality for adult trees was 0-7 times higher than in nondrought years, with larger trees showing a greater proportional increase. In figs, mortality was significantly higher in pioneers, but hemiepiphytes and roadside species were unaffected. Phenology was substantially affected. Leaf and flower/fruit production decreased or ceased during the drought and increased suddenly following renewed rain. Pollinators of dioecious figs became locally extinct during the drought, and other plant-animal interactions may also have been disrupted. The frequency and severity of droughts has increased substantially in the past three decades, and climate models suggest this may be the result of global warming. The impacts of the 1998 drought at Lambir Hills National Park suggest that, should this trend continue, a substantial alteration of habitats and overall loss of biodiversity can be expected in Borneo.",2001-04,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,63-75,NA,1,43,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,phenology; rain forest; aseasonal climate; conservation of biodiversity; fig wasp; local extinction; mortality,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

We investigated inter-annual and seasonal variation in stem diameter by three emergent tree species in a seasonally dry tropical forest in southeast Para, Brazil. Annual diameter growth rates by Swietenia macrophylla demonstrated strong positive correlation with annual rainfall totals during 19972009; Hymenaea courbaril growth rates demonstrated weak positive correlation, whereas Parkia pendula exhibited weak negative correlation. For both Swietenia and Hymenaea, annual diameter growth rates correlated positively and significantly with rainfall totals during the first 6 mo of the growing year (July to December). Vernier dendrometer bands monitored at 4-wk intervals during 35 yr confirmed strong seasonal effects on stem diameter expansion. Individuals of all three species expanded in unison during wet season months and were static or even contracted during dry season months. Stems of the deciduous Swietenia contracted as crowns were shed during the early dry season, expanded slightly as new crowns were flushed, and then contracted further during 35 wk flowering periods in the late dry season by newly mature crowns. The three species physiographic distribution patterns at the study site may partially underlie observed differences in annual and seasonal growth. With most global circulation models predicting conditions becoming gradually drier in southeast Amazonia over the coming decades, species such as Swietenia that perform best on the wet end of current conditions may experience reduced growth rates.

At landscape scales, geologic substrate-one of the least understood abiotic factors interacting with precipitation-may modulate phenological responses in these forests through a combination of mechanisms regulating water and nutrient use. We leveraged a phenological dataset from the semiarid island of Curacao to examine the extent to which plant phenology at multiple levels of biological organization diverge under different geologies. Monthly observations over a 30-month period of leaves, flowers, and fruits of 69 plant species of different life forms at three nearby sites differing in their underlaying geology were used to examine intra- and inter-annual plant responses at species, community, and system levels. The integration of leaf, flower, and fruit observations at intra-annual scales revealed diverse phenological strategies among species, broad associations with geologic substrate, and the extent of intra-specific variation as a function of geology. The community- and system-level analyses at inter-annual scales showed a reduction in mean leaf scores during the 30-month period, a weak and strong leafless period in 1993 and 1994, respectively, and differences among geologic substrates. Finally, we observed significant and positive relationships between precipitation and the phenophase scores; the strength of the relationships varied with phenophase and geologic substrate. Results of this work emphasize the importance of geologic substrate, and more broadly speaking landscape heterogeneity, in modulating plant phenological responses in tropical dry forests.

Results suggest also an important role of photoperiod and precipitation as climatic triggers of flowering patterns. Moreover, 16% of the taxa cultivated ex situ, mostly Polystachya, showed significant differences in flowering time between individuals originating from distinct climatic regions, pointing toward the existence of phenological ecotypes. Phenological plasticity, suggested by the lack of synchronized flowering in spatially disjunct populations of Polystachya, could explain the widespread radiation of this genus throughout tropical Africa.

Therefore, we examined the phenology of an evergreen dipterocarp forest in a climate exhibiting seasonal drought in Southeast Asia, with the aim of evaluating what evidence it brings to bear on the hypothesis that reproductive phenology in contemporary dipterocarp forests is the product of evolutionarily conserved responses to seasonal drought. We hypothesized that (1) dipterocarp forests that experience seasonal drought would exhibit annual reproduction and seasonality similar to that of forests with similar climates in other parts of the world, (2) within species, flowering frequency would be climate-dependent, not a fixed trait, and (3) climatic events that cue flowering in everwet forests would also cue flowering in seasonally dry forests. From 2001 to 2009, we monitored flowering and fruiting monthly for 1,344 trees (>300 spp.) in a forest in Khao Chong (KC), Thailand that experiences an annual 2-4month dry season, assessing frequency, duration, seasonality and synchrony of reproduction. We also examined phenological records for trees in three dipterocarp-dominated forests in everwet climates. Reproductive phenology of the KC forest was more similar to tropical forests with similar rainfall seasonality in other parts of the world than it was to dipterocarp-dominated forests in everwet regions of Southeast Asia. The forest exhibited annual reproduction, with peak flowering occurring at the end of the dry season and peak fruiting occurring early in the wet season. Approximately half of all species and individuals reproduced annually, including several species that are known to exhibit general flowering in everwet climates. Short dry spells appeared to cue flowering for early flowering species, while later flowering species may have responded to either low precipitation or temperature, consistent with data from everwet forests. GF behaviour also showed significant phylogenetic signal. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the phenological behaviour of both seasonal and everwet dipterocarp forests may have initially evolved in response to seasonal drought and that the general flowering phenomenon is a product of evolutionary conservatism.",2018-01,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,126-136,NA,1,106,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,fruiting; Dipterocarpaceae; general flowering; determinants of plant community diversity and structure; monsoon forests; reproduction; seasonally dry tropical forests; Southeast Asia; Thailand,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

To study phenology, we used Fourier analysis to identify the dominant cycles of flowering and fruiting for each individual tree and we identified the time of year African trees bloom and bear fruit and their relationship to local seasonality. Reproductive strategies were diverse, and no single regular cycle was found in >50% of individuals across all 12 sites. Additionally, we found annual flowering and fruiting cycles to be the most common. Sub-annual cycles were the next most common for flowering, whereas supra-annual patterns were the next most common for fruiting. We also identify variation in different subsets of species, with species exhibiting mainly annual cycles most common in West and West Central African tropical forests, while more species at sites in East Central and East African forests showed cycles ranging from sub-annual to supra-annual.

This rain forest study, at a nutrient-poor site with a seasonal climate in tropical Africa, provides new insights into the causes of this mode of phenological patterning. At Korup, Cameroon, 150 trees of the large, ectomycorrhizal caesalp, Microberlinia bisulcata, were recorded almost monthly for leafing, flowering and fruiting during 1995-2000. The series was extended to 1988-2004 with less detailed data. Individual transitions in phenology were analysed. Masting occurred when the dry season before fruiting was drier, and the one before that was wetter, than average. Intervals between events were usually 2 or 3 yr. Masting was associated with early leaf exchange, followed by mass flowering, and was highly synchronous in the population. Trees at higher elevation showed more fruiting. Output declined between 1995 and 2000. Mast fruiting in M. bisulcata appears to be driven by climate variation and is regulated by internal tree processes. The resource-limitation hypothesis was supported. An `alternative bearing' system seems to underlie masting.

Tropical tree communities in regions with seasonal climate usually adjust leaf-fall, flowering and fruiting phenology to climate seasonality. Here we monitored a tree community over a 4-year period in order to assess the relationship between the number of species presenting leaf fall, flower and fruit and annual variation in day length, precipitation and temperature. Moreover, we asked whether the three phenological variables have the same patterns in successive years. Simple regression analyses showed that the number of species shedding leaves was negatively related to the three environmental variables during the four years, with day length and temperature as the best predictors. There was also a relationship between day length and the number of species flowering and fruiting, while rainfall and temperature were only related to these phenophases in some years. The circular statistics indicate highly significant seasonality only for leaf fall, whereas for flowering and fruiting significant seasonal patterns were not detected. The number of species in leaf fall was correlated between all successive years. However, the number of species in flower and fruit was not significantly correlated between 2003 and 2004. Overall, our results suggest that leaf fall is highly predictable over time.

The Dynamic Model and the Growing Degree Hour Model were used to convert daily records of minimum and maximum temperature into horticulturally meaningful metrics. Regression analyses identified the chilling and forcing periods for chestnut and jujube. The forcing periods started when half the chilling requirements were fulfilled. Over the past 50 years, heat accumulation during tree dormancy increased significantly, while chill accumulation remained relatively stable for both species. Heat accumulation was the main driver of bloom timing, with effects of variation in chill accumulation negligible in Beijing's cold-winter climate.

Phenological models have been developed to forecast flowering date on olive mainly based on temperature. These models have used flowering datasets collected from trees growing under Mediterranean climatic conditions. In most of the cases, in those conditions, chilling requirements are rapidly fulfilled. In other cases, artificial modifications of the climatic conditions has been practiced by using growth chambers. In the present work, we compare the flowering phenology of `Picual' and `Arbequina' olive cultivars in Mediterranean conditions of Andalucia, Southern Spain, with those in Tenerife, Canary Islands with Sub-Tropical climate. The climatic conditions of Tenerife respect to Andalucia promoted an earlier flowering date but, more importantly, a much longer flowering period. This is mainly produced by an asynchronous flowering bud burst that will generate negative impacts on yield and quality. Quite likely, those differences on flowering phenology between Andalucia and Tenerife climatic conditions are mainly caused by the lack of winter chilling in Tenerife locations. Based on those results, we propose that future works studying the effect of lack of winter chilling on olive should include the length of the flowering period as a parameter to be modeled.

As global change is accelerating and the consequences for humans and nature are intensifying, there is an increasing demand for understanding and predicting the impacts and implications of global change on mountain ecosystems. Manipulation experiments are one of the major tools for testing the causal impacts of global change and establishing a mechanistic understanding of how these changes may transform the global biota from single organisms to entire ecosystems. Over the past three decades, hundreds of such experiments have been conducted in mountainous regions worldwide. To strengthen the experimental evidence for the possible ecological consequences of global change, we systematically reviewed the literature on global change experiments in mountains. We first investigated the spread of manipulation experiments to test the effects of different global change drivers on key biological and ecological processes from the organism to the ecosystem level. We then examined and discussed the balance of evidence regarding the impact of these global change drivers on biological and ecological processes, and outlined the possible consequences for mountain ecosystems. Finally, we identified research gaps and proposed future directions for global change research in mountain environments. Among the major drivers, temperature was manipulated most frequently, generally showing consistent strong impacts between biological and ecosystem processes, functional groups, and habitat types. There is also strong evidence suggesting that changes in water and nutrient availability have a direct impact on the life history and functioning of mountain organisms. Despite these important findings, there are several gaps that require urgent attention. These include experiments testing adult trees in tropical and boreal regions, assessing animal responses and biotic interactions, and investigating aquatic environments and soil systems more extensively. A broader approach that integrates experimental data with field observations and relies on international collaboration through coordinated experiments could help address these gaps and provide a more consistent and robust picture of the impacts of global change on mountain ecosystems.",2024-11,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,4,94,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Review",NA,NA,NA,climate change; biodiversity; global change; alpine; ecological experiments; ecosystem functioning; mountain; warming,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Phenological studies for the Brazilian savannah plants are geographically restricted and long-term variation is still unclear. Thus the use of herbarium data can provide long-term phenological evaluation and it is important to understand the phenology-climate dynamics on broader scales. We used climatic data and 252 herbarium specimens collected between 1961 and 2012 to examine the phenological trends in Leptolobium dasycarpum and L. elegans (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae). We tested the effect of average temperature and rainfall of each specimen's month of flowering and/or fruiting and the three months prior using generalized least squares models. The species presented similar flowering and fruiting seasons, peaking in the wet season. Across this hotspot of biodiversity characterized by extraordinary environmental variations between the wet and dry seasons, L. dasycarpum and L. elegans tend to delay their phenophases with increasing temperature and precipitation. However, we did not find a significant alteration of the phenophase dates over the 52 years.

We used a mixed-methods approach that included surveys of 907 households, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The results indicate that resident birds such as white-browed coucals and turacos and migrant birds such as eagles and swallows were important indicators of the onset of rains. Butterflies were an important indicator for the cessation of rains, and red ants were an indicator for the onset of rains. Among the abiotic indicators, winds, clouds, earthquakes, and cloud formation on Mount Rwenzori were important indicators. Behavior of cattle at the onset of rains was important among the pastoralists, and flowering of coffee plants was important among the arable farmers. The behavior of the biotic indicators was driven by the availability of food, water, or other necessities. An attempt to explain the phenology underlying the behavior of biotic indicators and the meteorological science underlying some of the abiotic indicators is made. Although biotic environmental indicators are rudimentary and their accuracy is influenced by external factors such as climate change, they provide climate information within the locality of the farmers.

While the proximate cues for flowering initiation are well documented in the temperate region, it is still unclear what the flowering cues are in the tropics, especially in the subtropics.

We observed considerable interannual variation in the median FFDs for the study species, ranging from 21 to 101 days. The early-spring flowering species tended to have greater interannual variation in FFDs than the summer flowering species. For 13 study species, temperature cues best explained interannual variation in FFDs. Cool temperatures in the previous fall/winter and warm temperatures in the current spring (or previous summer) might trigger the onset of flowering in these 13 species. Cues associated with photoperiod and irradiance also predicted interannual variation in FFDs with small root mean square error (<1.5 census intervals) for 12 species but generally had higher prediction errors than temperature-related cues. Cues associated with seasonal variation in rainfall failed to predict flowering times in any species.

We determined flowering and fruiting phenology, and availability of tree-cavities and snags in deciduous and semi-deciduous tropical dry forest from 2009 to 2016, prior-to and following landfall by hurricanes Jova (category 2) in 2011 and Patricia (category 4) in 2015. We also evaluated reproduction of the threatened Lilac-crowned Amazon (Amazona finschi) throughout this period. Flowering and fruiting phenology was reduced during the first year post-hurricanes, but the major Hurricane Patricia had a significantly greater impact on fruit and flower abundance than the minor Hurricane Jova. ARIMA time series modelling indicated that deciduous forest recovered phenological cycles by the second-year post-Hurricane Jova, but semi-deciduous forest demonstrated a level shift in fruiting phenology after landfall by this minor hurricane. Subsequent landfall by the major Hurricane Patricia then also led to a level shift in fruiting phenology of deciduous forest. Tree-cavity and snag resources were reduced by half post-Hurricane Jova, and remaining tree-cavities had significantly wider entrances, while snags were of larger diameters. Hurricane Jova caused the loss of 35.6% of Lilac-crowned Amazon nest-sites, whereas a significantly greater 61.5% of parrot nest-sites were lost after Hurricane Patricia. New nest-cavities used by parrots after Hurricane Jova had significantly wider entrances compared to nest-cavities used prior to hurricane impacts. In the first breeding season post-hurricanes, Lilac-crowned Amazons delayed nest initiation, few pairs nested, and reproductive output was low. Parrot reproduction recovered in subsequent years post-Hurricane Jova, but parrot reproductive output remained among the lowest recorded for the species in the second year post-Hurricane Patricia. Our results suggest that deciduous forest may be resilient to low-level hurricane impacts, such as Hurricane Jova, but semi-deciduous forest did not recover over the five years after hurricane landfall, and is a priority for restoration management. By comparison, the major Hurricane Patricia may be characterized as an extreme climatic event as this was coupled with extreme ecological responses of level-shifts in fruiting phenology, and had severe cascading effects on nest-site availability and reproduction for large-bodied cavity-nesting species, such as the Lilac-crowned Amazon.",15/10/2018,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,164-175,NA,,426,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,ARIMA modelling; Cascading effects; Cavity-nesters; Extreme climatic event; Hurricane disturbance; Psittaciformes,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Factors that were assessed included the size of the tree, access to light, the impacts of liana load, effects of tree growth, and variation between guilds of trees. Most flowering occurs at the end of the long dry season from February to April. Trees that had access to more light flowered and fruited more frequently. Pioneer and non-pioneer light-demanding species tended to reproduce more frequently than shade-bearing species. Trees that grew faster between 1993 and 2011 also fruited more frequently. When examining all factors, growth rate, tree size, and crown position were all important for fruiting, while liana load but not growth rate was important in reducing flowering. Trees in BFR show a large decline in fruiting over 24years, particularly in non-pioneer light demanders, shade-bearers, and species that produce fleshy fruits eaten by primates. The decline in fruit production is of concern and is having impacts on primate diets and potential recruitment of mahogany trees.

A fundamental question is: what are the drivers of flowering time strategy in a species?2 We assembled mean flowering times for the indigenous dicotyledonous flora of New Zealand (n = 1303 species, including 177 tree species) and used phylogenetic models to determine how climate, plant traits, and evolutionary history (phylogeny) controlled interspecific variation in flowering times across an island flora.3. Across all species, on average, flowering was 19 days earlier in abiotically pollinated species relative to biotically pollinated species, 23 days earlier in woody species, relative to herbaceous species, 45 days earlier in species with fleshy-fruits, relative to species with dry fruits and 31 days earlier in gender dimorphic species, relative to cosexual species. Species in warmer and drier climates flowered earlier than those growing under cool, moist climates.4. When all factors were considered together, the strongest influence on flowering time was sexual system: gender dimorphic species flowered earlier than cosexuals, even after accounting for other factors.5. Synthesis. We propose that these differences in flowering time arise because of sexual selection for early male flowering and sexual conflict between male and female individuals.

The aim of this study was to describe flowering patterns for more than 100 species in Tinigua Park, Colombia, and to propose which factors may trigger flower production (e.g., rainfall, temperature, cloud cover, and photoperiod). Data gathered in 5.6 km of phenological transects during 4 yr and complementary information indicated that the vast majority of species showed intraspecific synchronization, and annual production was the most common pattern, followed by episodic frequency. The annual patterns were common in tree species, while episodic patterns were common in lianas. Simple and multiple regression analyses suggested several aspects of photoperiod as the most likely triggers for flowering in most species. However, the fact that many of these species produce flowers in different periods each year, suggests that the proportion of species responding to photoperiodic cues is less that 23 percent in this community. The flowering times of taxonomically related species seldom showed significantly staggered distributions; however they do not necessarily occur at the same time, suggesting that flowering patterns are not strongly constrained by phylogeny.",2008-09,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,559-567,NA,5,40,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,phenology; photoperiod; flowering frequency; plant habits; proximate factors; Tinigua National Park; tropical seasonal forest,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Different scales of temporal changes in fruits, for example within-versus across-year variability, are driven by different processes, but are not always easy to disentangle. We apply generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to study a long-term fruit presence-absence data set of individual trees collected from a high-altitude Afromontane tropical rain forest site within Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. Our primary aim was to highlight and evaluate GAMM methodology, and quantify both intra-and interannual changes in fruit production. First, we conduct several simulation experiments to study the practical utility of model selection and smooth term estimation relevant for disentangling intra-and interannual variability. These simulations indicate that estimation of nonlinearity and seasonality is generally accurately identified using asymptotic theory. Applied to the empirical data set, we found that the forest-level fruiting variability arises from both regular seasonality and significant interannual variability, with the years 2009-2010 in particular showing a significant increase in the presence of fruits-driven by increased productivity of most species, and a regular annual peak associated occurring at the end of one of the two dry seasons. Our analyses illustrate a statistical framework for disentangling short-term increases/decreases in fruiting effort while pinpointing specific times in which fruiting is atypical, providing a first step for assessing the impacts of regular and irregular (e.g., climate change) abiotic covariates on fruiting phenology. Some consequences of the rich diversity of fruiting patterns observed here for the population biology of frugivores in BINP are also discussed.",2013-09,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,3141-3151,NA,9,3,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,climate change; phenology; Bwindi Impenetrable National Park; nonparametric models; plant reproductive ecology; tropical forest ecology,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

The diverse drivers of phenology act across multiple temporal scales. For example, abiotic constraints favor synchronous reproduction (positive covariance among species), while biotic interactions can favor synchrony or compensatory dynamics (negative covariance). We used wavelet analyses to examine phenology of community flower and seed production for 45 tree species across multiple temporal scales in a tropical dry forest in Puerto Rico with marked rainfall seasonality. Weasked three questions: (1) do species exhibit synchronous or compensatory temporal dynamics in reproduction, (2) do interspecific differences in phenology reflect variable responses to rainfall, and (3) is interspecific variation in phenology and response to a major drought associated with functional traits that mediate responses to moisture? Community-level flowering was synchronized at seasonal scales (similar to 5-6mo) and at short scales (similar to 1 mo, following rainfall). However, seed rain exhibited significant compensatory dynamics at intraseasonal scales (similar to 3 mo), suggesting interspecific variation in temporal niches. Species with large leaves (associated with sensitivity to water deficit) peaked in reproduction synchronously with the peak of seasonal rainfall (similar to 5mo scale). By contrast, species with high wood specific gravity (associated with drought resistance) tended to flower in drier periods. Flowering of tall species and those with large leaves was most tightly linked to intraseasonal (similar to 2mo scale) rainfall fluctuations. Although the 2015 drought dramatically reduced community-wide reproduction, functional traits were not associated with the magnitude of species-specific declines. Our results suggest opposing drivers of synchronous versus compensatory dynamics at different temporal scales. Phenology associations with functional traits indicated that distinct strategies for coping with seasonality underlie phenological diversity. Observed drought responses highlight the importance of non-linear community responses to climate. Community phenology exhibits scale-specific patterns highlighting the need for multi-scale approaches to community dynamics.",2016-11,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,11,11,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND Publisher: IOP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,drought; precipitation; community assembly; lag effects; time-series,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

We used a large-scale experimental reduction of throughfall in an eastern-central Amazon forest to study the phenological response to drought of an abundant subcanopy tree, Coussarea racemosa. We hypothesized that drought would alter the production and the timing of reproduction, as well as the number of viable fruits. The study system comprised two 1-ha plots in the Tapajos National Forest, Para, Brazil: a dry plot where 50% of incoming precipitation (80% throughfall) was diverted from the soil during the six-month wet season beginning in January 2000, and a wet plot that received natural rainfall inputs. Fruit production of C. racemosa was quantified every 15 days using 100 litter traps (0.5 m(2)) in each plot. The production of new leaves and flowers was recorded monthly for C. racemosa individuals. Soil water, pre-dawn leaf water potential and solar radiation were measured to help interpret phenological patterns. Over the -3.5-year period (April 2000 through December 2003), total fruit production remained similar between plots, declining by 12%. In 2003, production was four times higher in both plots than in previous years. In the dry plot, fruit fall shifted 40 and 60 days later into the dry season in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Total fruit fall dry mass production was variable across the study period. Foliage and flower production coincided with peak irradiance early in the dry season until delays in flowering appeared in the dry plot in 2002 and 2003. Plant water stress, through its influence on leaf developmental processes and, perhaps, inhibition of photosynthesis, appears to have altered both the timing of fruit fall and the quality and number of seeds produced.",2006-11,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,181-189,NA,2,150,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,drought; tropical; forest; biology; reproductive,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Here, we show that flower and seed production both increase during El Nino events in an old-growth tropical forest in Panama. Flower production, but not seed production, has also increased over the past 18 years. The sustained increase in flower production was greater for 33 hana species than for 48 tree species.

The proximate environmental cues that synchronize these general flowering events have not been evaluated systematically because there have been no long-term, high temporal resolution, species-level records from the region. We present 13 years of weekly flowering records for five Shorea species as well as daily temperature and rainfall records from the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. We constructed models to evaluate hypothesized relationships between flowering and cool temperature, drought, and additive and synergistic effects of cool temperature and drought for each species. Model parameters include periods of time for floral cue accumulation and flower development and temperature and/or rainfall thresholds required for floral initiation. Parameters estimated using flowering observations from 2001 to 2011 were used to forecast flowering for 2011-2014. We show that drought and cool temperatures acting synergistically best explain the timing of flowering events for all Shorea species in the section Mutica and forecast the largest general flowering event accurately. Periods estimated for signal accumulation ranged from 54 to 90 days among species. Periods estimated for flowers to develop ranged between 43 and 96 days and closely followed the interspecific sequence of flowering in the Shorea species. Drought and temperature thresholds also varied among species, with Shorea maxwelliana requiring the most severe drought and Shorea leprosula the lowest temperatures. Synthesis. Our results indicate that cool temperatures and low rainfall occurring on seasonal time-scales of about 2-3 months rather than brief cold snaps or brief droughts best explain general flowering in Shorea species at the Pasoh Forest Reserve. Low rainfall is equally likely in winter (December-February) and summer (July-August) and cool temperatures are most likely in winter at Pasoh, which explains why general flowering events are restricted to spring and fall, with more frequent and stronger flowering in spring. In addition, species-specific sensitivity to environmental cues suggests that future climate change will have differential impacts on the frequency of reproduction, with potential consequences for regeneration of these dominant species of lowland tropical forests.",2018-03,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,586-598,NA,2,106,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,climate change; drought; plant-climate interactions; phenology; synchrony; flowering time; forecasting; lowland dipterocarp forest; model,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

As expected, isolated trees had disrupted mating patterns and reduced fitness. However, for dry provenances, fitness was negatively related to correlated paternity, while for mesic provenances, fitness was correlated positively with outcrossing rate and negatively with correlated paternity. Poorer performance of mesic provenances is likely because of reduced effective pollen donor density due to poorer environmental suitability and greater disturbance history.

At the community level, rainfall was positively related to flowering phenology. However, environmental variables had different effects on flowering phenology in species with different growth forms. Specifically, variation in rainfall is the most important factor in flowering in herbaceous species, while day length has a greater impact on the response of flowering in woody plants. Pollination syndrome showed a close relationship with species growth form and is related to the duration of flowering. Our hypothesis that rainfall has an important effect on the flowering phenology of plant species of this temperate forest was supported; however, day length also showed high a correlation with flower production in trees and shrubs.

WTUKXY2N,conferencePaper,2001,"Grabherr, G; Gottfried, M; Pauli, H",High mountain environment as indicator of global change.,GLOBAL CHANGE AND PROTECTED AREAS,0-7923-6918-1,,,NA,"The recent debate on global change effects on the living world is still characterized by lack of confidency as depending on rather hypothetical assumptions and predictions. This is a consequence of missing global ecological observation networks comparable to those which have been established for climate, glacier movements, atmospheric composition etc. Alpine biota such as grasslands, dwarf shrub heaths, alpine steppes, the tropical paramo, vegetation fragments at the high elevational limits of plant life, snow beds offer a broad spectrum for permanent long term ecological monitoring as it could be demonstrated by the few already available examples such as biodiversity changes in the Central Alps during this century. Most of these biota are simply structured, show clear habitat dependences, thus indicating change of one dominating environmental factor, and are in many high mountain regions still in a natural or at least seminatural state which means that direct anthropogenic effects could be excluded, or clearly described. As indicators for short term effects (< 10 years) we recommend 1. flowering phenology of vascular plants, 2. composition and abundance of moss species; for medium term effects (< 50 years) 1. structural parameters of plant communities such as rank/frequency relations, or horizontal individual distribution pattern, 2. species composition of plant communities, appearance of exotics and pathogens, 3. abundance, appearance and disappearance of selected animals (soil and above ground). A simple functional classification based on CO2- requirement, thermal and water relations, mobility and trophic characters is provided for selecting such species.

Based on the well-established relationships of wood density with water-storing capacity and cavitation vulnerability in woody plants, we hypothesized differential vegetative and reproductive phenological responses to environmental cues for hardwood and softwood species. To test this hypothesis, we compared phenological patterns of pairs of conspecific populations of 10 species differing in wood density, occurring in two localities with slightly different climatic regimes, and evaluated the influence of three environmental variables (rainfall, photoperiod, and temperature) on them. Our results, based on the assessment of the overlap of the phenological curves of conspecific populations occurring in different sites and on linear modeling, showed different effects of the environmental factors on phenophase attributes, depending on wood density of the study species, thus supporting our hypothesis. Leaf out in softwood species took place in the dry season, they shed the foliage at the first signs of drought, and once leafless, they flowered and fruited shortly after. By contrast, hardwood species bore leaves and flowers in the rainy season, shed their leaves several months after the rain ceased, and produced fruits during the dry season. We conclude that the role of environmental variables in cueing growth and reproduction cycles in SDTF tree species is interrelated with their wood density, a key endogenous factor crucially linked to plant hydraulics in these water-limited ecosystems.

Indirect approaches have recently revealed reproductive isolation resulting from flowering time (so-called isolation by time, IBT). Since phenological processes can be subject to selection, the persistence of flowering asynchrony may be due to opposing selective pressures during mating, dispersal, and regeneration phases. Our study aimed to investigate phenology, fruit handling by animals, and their interaction in a timber tree species, Milicia excelsa. Methods: We analyzed phenological data collected over 6 years on 69 genotyped trees in a Cameroonian natural rainforest complemented by data from germination trials and field observations of dispersers. Key results: Initiation of flowering was correlated with variation in temperature and relative humidity, but was also affected by genetic factors: pairwise differences in flowering time between nearby individuals correlated with kinship coefficient, and earliness of flowering remained stable over time. A decrease in mean seed production per fruit with increasing flowering time suggests selection against late bloomers. However, germination rate was not affected by seed collection date, and the main seed disperser, the bat Eidolon helvum, seemed to increase in abundance at the end of the reproductive season and preferred trees in open habitats where early and late bloomers are expected. Conclusions: The pairwise approach performs well in detecting IBT. The persistence of different mating pools in such a case may result from a trade off between selective forces during the mating and seed dispersal processes.",2012-09,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,1453-1463,NA,9,99,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,tropical rainforest; flowering phenology; flowering synchrony; Moraceae; feeding behavior; germination; isolation by time; Milicia excelsa; reproductive isolation; reproductive success,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Then, we grouped the spatial variations into temperature effect phases. Lastly, we examined relationships between mean temperature during the positive effect phase and effective accumulated temperature during the negative effect phase. Results show that Melia azedarach spring phenology is positively influenced (delayed) by preseason winter temperatures and negatively influenced (advanced) by preseason spring temperatures. The negative spring temperature effect on the three phenophases was detected at all stations, while the positive winter temperature effect was apparent only at 51%-78% of stations. The number of stations with the positive winter temperature effect is larger in colder areas and for earlier occurring phenophases, and smaller in warmer areas and for later occurring phenophases. In addition, either negative responses of spring phenology to spring temperature or positive responses of spring phenology to winter temperature are more sensitive at warmer locations than colder locations. Further analyses indicate that the lower the mean temperature during the positive winter temperature effect phase at a specific station, the less the effective accumulated temperature needed for budburst, first leaf unfolding, and first flowering during the negative spring temperature effect phase at the same station. This implies that effective accumulated temperature during the negative effect phase depends on temperature status during the positive effect phase.

They consist of sparse-to-moderate tree cover over a ground layer dominated by C4 grasses. The climate is monsoonal, wet-dry tropical. Temperatures are high year-round. Rainfall is summer-dominated, with strong continental-scale gradients in mean annual rainfall from the mesic savannas of the near-coastal regions to the arid interior. Soils are generally nutrient-poor. The savannas have evolved over millions of years, are species-rich, and are not derived from closed forest systems by recent human activity. Structure and composition of the vegetation varies strongly with variation in mean annual rainfall and soil type. Tree cover increases with increasing rainfall, but declines as soil clay content increases. Phenology is strongly seasonal, but growth, flowering and fruiting can occur in the tree stratum during the dry season. Fire is frequent and extensive; late dry season fires are more intense than early dry season fires. The ground stratum is relatively insensitive to variation in fire regime, whereas tree abundance and recruitment declines with increasing fire intensity. Savannas account for ca. 3% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, and there is considerable potential for managing fire regimes such that emissions are reduced and environmental and social benefits are enhanced.",2017,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,368-388,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,"THE PITT BUILDING, TRUMPINGTON ST, CAMBRIDGE CB2 1RP, CAMBS, ENGLAND",English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Type: Article; Book Chapter,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Seasonal breaks in flowering have implications for plant reproductive success, population structure, and gene flow as well as resource availability for pollinators and dependent animals. Most reports of multiple within-season flowering events describe only two distinct flowering episodes. In this study, we set out to better quantify distinct within-season flowering events in highly variable Sky Islands plant communities. Across a > 1,200 m elevation gradient, we documented a strong tendency for multiple within-season flowering events. In both distinct spring and summer seasons, we observed greater than two distinct within-season flowering in more than 10 % of instances. Patterns were clearly mediated by the different climate factors at work in the two seasons. The spring season, which is influenced by both temperature and precipitation, showed a mixed response, with the greatest tendency for multiple flowering events occurring at mid-elevations and functional types varying in their responses across the gradient. In the summer season, during which flowering across the gradient is limited by localized precipitation, annual plants exhibited the fewest within-season flowering events and herbaceous perennial plants showed the greatest. Additionally, more distinct events occurred at lower elevations.

The aim is to improve our knowledge on possible vegetation response to possible climate change. Within the Sudanian site, average annual rainfall is 1200 mm, extending from April to October, while, in the Sahelian site, it is 370 mm, occurring from June to September. Physical data were collected from the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis research programme. The phenology of the dominant species was monitored in four types of vegetation cover at the wetter site, and in three types of vegetation cover at the drier site. For each sampled plant, leafing, flowering and fruiting were recorded as binary variables in terms of the presence/absence of phenophases. A small proportion of the variability of each phenophase occurrence is explained by the logit models. However, rainfall rise is significantly linked to leafing probability increase in the Sahelian site but not in the Sudanian site. Day length extension and temperature decrease are significantly correlated with an increase in leafing in the Sudanian site, but not in the Sahelian. On both sites, the increase in cumulative rainfall is not found to be linked to an increased probability of reproductive phenophases (negative or non-significant relationships). Air temperature is positively correlated with flowering rate in the Sudanian site, but, all other factors being constant, no climate factors are found to be highly significant of flowering occurrence in the Sahel. Fruiting probability is positively correlated mainly with temperature within the Sahelian site. Leafing occurrence is positively correlated with soil moisture in the 0-1 m layer for the Sudanian site, but not for the Sahelian site. Significant relationships between fruiting occurrence and soil moisture may reflect a prior selection of plants on fruiting period that maximizes seed dispersion and germination differently at the two sites. While vegetative and reproduction schedules may be determined by specific genetic factors, the physical environment controls the possibility of their expression. Reduction of the rainfall amount and intensity may increase reproduction rates in wet areas. Although this factor should decrease leafing rate, it does not influence reproduction at dry sites, except through the decrease in air humidity. In wetter areas, increasing temperature may reduce leafing, but may increase reproduction rates. Cover reduction may have an impact on local physical factors and, consequently, probably also affects vegetation phenology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, machine learning (ML) has been used successfully to develop phenological models based on ground observations. However, fitting an observation series that has been observed for only a few years (or even a decade) can easily lead to overfitting, and it is still a great challenge to predict future phenology accurately based on a short observation series. Here, based on historical ground phenological observations, we construct an ML-based binary classification phenological model that can be applied to temperate trees. Innovation We thoroughly describe the construction process of a species-specific ML-based binary classification phenological model that is suitable for phenological predictions in both spring and autumn. Through experiments, we evaluate 18 commonly used ML classification algorithms and the effects of two parameters on the prediction performance of the model. Finally, we compare the performance between the binary classification model and six widely used ecophysiological models for accuracy of spring phenological prediction. Main conclusions The median root mean square error (RMSE) of the binary classification model for the first flowering date (93 observation series) was only 2.99 days, which proves that it is a good method of phenological prediction for temperate trees. This model can effectively overcome the insufficient sample size of ground observations for specific species and provide new insights of phenological predictions for tropical and subtropical trees. The comparison of different ML algorithms showed that the median root mean square errors of the six algorithms were <3.5 days, and lower than those of six ecophysiological models (>3.7 days) in prediction of spring phenology. In addition, this model can help us to infer plant physiological mechanisms and drivers of phenological change and provide more accurate predictions of plant phenological responses to climate change.",2023-01,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,178-190,NA,1,32,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,plant phenology; binary classification; ecophysiological model; ground observations; machine learning; phenological model,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the ecological processes that are brought about by phenological expression and regeneration. This study postulates that phenology, regeneration, and species dominance are a sequence of intermediary processes through which environmental conditions affect forest structure. In a dry deciduous forest of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India, we analysed the relationships between various environmental characteristics, phenological parameters, seedling density, sapling density, and tree density using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The study revealed an immediate association between climate and leafing (Path Coefficient: -0.67; T: 9.374; p < 0.01), flowering (Path Coefficient: -0.61; T: 2.981; p < 0.01), and fruiting (Path Coefficient: -0.67; T: 3.51; p < 0.01). The sequential association between seedling and sapling density and forest structure was also significant (p < 0.5). However, these were found to have no direct link with phenology (T < 1; p > 0.05) which has been assumed to be the outcome of anthropogenic activities in the forest having an impact on the system. Comparatively, synchrony of fruit senescence and synchrony of flowering were the principal events that supported regeneration more than others, each accounting for 79 % and 74 % of their data, respectively. On the other hand, the monthly minimum temperature (contributing 97 % of data) was a key contribution to the principal component (PC1) and was primarily responsible for triggering the phenological cycle. Most of the important phenophases were seasonal (Rayleigh's Z varied from 10.93 to 50.01; p < 0.01) except the fruit initiation (Rayleigh's Z = 0.48; p = 0.2). Most of the species (72 % of all species) had regeneration densities that were corresponding to their competitive scores. Similarly, density of adult tree species proportionated with their density in regeneration stage (sapling and seedling), supporting the research hypothesis. However, several deviant species suggested that the system was affected by a wide range of other factors.

Methods Herbarium specimens represent a significant resource with which to study plant phenology. Nevertheless, phenological annotation of herbarium specimens is time-consuming, requires substantial human investment, and is difficult to mobilize at large taxonomic scales. We created and evaluated new methods based on deep learning techniques to automate annotation of phenological stages and tested these methods on four herbarium data sets representing temperate, tropical, and equatorial American floras. Results Deep learning allowed correct detection of fertile material with an accuracy of 96.3%.

Although many studies have focused on tropical rainforests, there is a paucity of studies on seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs), particularly in Asia, and few studies have focused on seedling dynamics, which are expected to be strongly affected by drought. Seedlings in SDTFs are generally more drought-tolerant than those in the rainforests, and the effects of El Nino-induced droughts may differ between SDTF and tropical rainforests. In this study, we explored the impact of El Nino-induced drought at an SDTF in northern Thailand by monitoring the seedling dynamics at monthly intervals for 7 years, including a period of strong El Nino. The effects were compared between two forest types in an SDTF: a deciduous dipterocarp forest (DDF), dominated by deciduous species, and an adjacent lower montane forest (LMF) with more evergreen species. El Nino-induced drought increased seedling mortality in both the forest types. The effect of drought was stronger in evergreen than in the deciduous species, resulting in higher mortality in the LMF during El Nino. However, El Nino increased seedling recruitment only in the DDF, mainly because of the massive recruitment of the deciduous oak, Quercus brandisiana (Fagaceae), which compensated for the mortality of seedlings in the DDF. As a result, El Nino increased seedling density in the DDF and decreased it in the LMF. This is the first long-term study to identify the differences in the impacts of El Nino on seedlings between the two forest types, and two leaf habits, evergreen and deciduous, in Southeast Asia. Our findings suggest that future climate change may alter the species composition and spatial distribution of seedlings in Asian SDTFs.",2023-01,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,451-461,NA,2,29,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,climate change; deciduous dipterocarp forest; El Nino-induced drought; long-term data; lower montane forest; Quercus brandisiana; seedling dynamics,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

We investigated the role of these tree traits in the seasonal timing of flowering and subsequent fruiting. Flowering and fruiting time of 24 tree species was recorded over two consecutive annual cycles and their relationships with the abovementioned tree specific traits were examined across the species. In leaf-exchanging species having higher SWD and LMA, low LSI and short deciduousness, flowering coincides with leaf transitional state when vegetative growth is at its minimum, and fruit formation and leaf flushing are both supported at the same time. However, > 4-months-deciduous species with lowest SWD and LMA, higher LSI and longer deciduousness showed predominantly dry season flowering, subsequent fruiting on leafless shoots and distinct separation of vegetative and flowering phenophases. In contrast, intermediate species (< 2 months-deciduous, 2-4-months-deciduous) showed wider flowering range through summer, rainy, autumn or winter seasons. Fruiting duration varies considerably with variation in the flowering time; ca. 5-14 months in summer flowering species; 7-12 months in rainy flowering species; 6-10 months in autumn flowering species, 4-9 months in dry season flowering and 3-7 months in winter flowering species. In most species, fruit maturation occurred just prior to the onset of rains, ensuring seedling survival. The ability of tree species to withstand (leaf-exchange) or avoid (deciduousness) drought stress and varying seasonal flowering timings appear to be the principal mechanisms for successful survival and reproduction under extremely dry and seasonal climate. Since environmental characteristics affect flowering and fruiting either directly (e.g. through conditions in the habitat) or indirectly (e.g. through deciduousness, LMA, SWD and LSI), the impact of probable global climatic change will have long implications on reproduction of dry tropical trees.",2011-06,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,985-998,NA,6,212,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,Wood density; Deciduousness; Flowering types; Leaf mass per area; Time lag; Tropical deciduous forest,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Accept,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

We consider how existing, and emerging, tropical phenology monitoring programs can be made most effective by investigating major sources of noise in data collection at a long-term study site. Researchers at Lope NP, Gabon, have recorded monthly crown observations of leaf, flower and fruit phenology for 88 plant species since 1984. For a subset of these data, we first identified dominant regular phenological cycles, using Fourier analysis, and then tested the impact of observation uncertainty on cycle detectability, using expert knowledge and generalized linear mixed modeling (827 individual plants of 61 species). We show that experienced field observers can provide important information on major sources of noise in data collection and that observation length, phenophase visibility and duration are all positive predictors of cycle detectability. We find that when a phenological event lasts >4wk, an additional 10yr of data increases cycle detectability by 114 percent and that cycle detectability is 92 percent higher for the most visible events compared to the least. We also find that cycle detectability is four times as high for flowers compared to ripe fruits after 10yr. To maximize returns in the short-term, resources for long-term monitoring of phenology should be targeted toward highly visible phenophases and events that last longer than the observation interval. In addition, programs that monitor flowering phenology are likely to accurately detect regular cycles more quickly than those monitoring fruits, thus providing a baseline for future assessments of change. Resume La phenologie est un element cle du fonctionnement de l'ecosysteme et est de plus en plus incluse dans l'evaluation des changements ecologiques. Nous considerons comment les programmes de surveillance de la phenologie tropicale, aussi bien courants qu'emergents, peuvent etre rendus plus efficaces en etudiant les principales sources de bruit liees a la collecte de donnees sur un site d'etude a long terme.

Nous constatons que lorsqu'un evenement phenologique dure plus de 4 semaines, 10 annees de donnees supplementaires augmentent la detectabilite du cycle de 114 pour cent, et que la detectabilite du cycle est 92 pour cent plus elevee pour les evenements les plus visibles par rapport aux moins visibles. Nous constatons egalement que la detection du cycle varie selon la phenophase, etant quatre fois plus elevee pour les fleurs que pour les fruits murs apres 10 ans. Afin de maximiser les rendements a court terme, les ressources allouees a la surveillance a long terme devraient cibler les evenements phenologiques hautement visibles dont la duree depasse celle de l'intervalle d'observation.

Fig trees (Ficus) need to produce figs year-round to support their short-lived fig wasp pollinators, but this requirement is partially de-coupled in dioecious species, where female trees only develop seeds, not pollinator offspring. This allows female trees to concentrate seed production at more favorable times of the year. Ficus squamosa is a riparian species whose dispersal is mainly by water, rather than animals. Seeds can float and travel in long distances. We recorded the leaf and reproductive phenology of 174 individuals for three years in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand. New leaves were produced throughout the year. Fig production occurred year-round, but with large seasonal variations that correlated with temperature and rainfall. Female and male trees initiated maximal fig crops at different times, with production in female trees confined mainly to the rainy season and male figs concentrating fig production in the preceding months, but also often bearing figs continually. Ficus squamosa concentrates seed production by female plants at times when water levels are high, favouring dispersal by water, and asynchronous flowering within male trees allow fig wasps to cycle there, providing them with potential benefits by maintaining pollinators for times when female figs become available to pollinate.",24/03/2016,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,3,11,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA Publisher: PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

Quantitative assessment was made at 15 day interval for all the phenophases (leaf initiation, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting) by tagging 40 (forty) trees over a period of two years (2012-14). To test seasonal influence on the phenology of Barringtonia acutangula different phenophases were correlated with environmental variables and statistical spearman's rank correlation coefficient was employed. Aridity index was computed that delineate influence of rainfall and temperature together on any phenophases. Leaf initiation showed positively significant correlation with temperature (r(s)=0.601, p=<.05) during the year 2012-2013 whereas it was significantly correlated with rainfall (r(s)=0.583, p=<.05) and aridity index (rs=0.583, p=<.05) during the year 2013-2014.

Curative property of Jamun fruits against Diabetes mellitus type 2 has boosted its commercial orcharding, which necessitates gathering precise information on phenological responses to changing temperature and precipitation. A modified three digit extended Biologische Bundesanstalt Bundessortenamt and Chemische Industrie (BBCH) scale was developed and assigned 3 digit codes to describe the important phenological stages. Eight principal growth stages and 36 secondary stages have been described with illustrations that occur sequentially in Jamun under subtropics. Interestingly the primary phenophases of vegetative phenology i.e. bud development, leaf development and shoot development showed a large overlap and the interrupted phenostages are attributed to the inclemental weather conditions. Thus, under a warm temperate subtropical climate in the northern hemisphere, Jamun canopies presented two vegetative flushes (represented as mesostage 1 and 2), the second flush registering highest frequency (60-80 %) in months of September to October. This is in contrast to continuous growth under tropical climate conditions, wherein growth cessation does not occur. While vegetative growth flush occurred twice a year in a major part of canopy, flower-bearing panicles emerged on mature shoots in the months of February and March. Floral induction characterized by the inflorescence emergence and subsequent blooming closely followed the upswing of average monthly minimum and maximum temperature curve under subtropics, while average temperature downturn coupled with high precipitation released the vegetative flush episode. The phenostage (5) involving inflorescence emergence and growth occurred once in the subtropical climate, sustaining for around 8 weeks, followed by flowering (6) and fruit development(7). As with other evergreen trees, vegetative growth did not depict cessation and dormancy was observed after harvest and onset of winter. The correlation of emerging phenological events with temperature and humidity established the utility of the BBCH code for forecasting the outcomes of the canopy shoots. Early fruit production and synchronous shoot growth can be targeted by imposing shoot pruning strategy immediately after harvest at dormancy. The study establishes interplay of ecogeography and germplasm for expression of standard phenostages and the impact of climate change on fruit productivity.",01/06/2021,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,,283,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,Phenology; BBCH scale; Climatic variables; Codification; Tree species; Underutilized fruit,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name

This intriguing flowering event is often succeeded by mast fruiting, which provides a temporary yet substantial burst of food resources for animals, particularly frugivores. However, the physiological mechanism that triggers general flowering, particularly in dipterocarp species, is not well understood largely due to its irregular and unpredictable occurrences in the tall and dense forests. To shed light on this mechanism, we employed ecological transcriptomic analyses on an RNA-seq dataset of a general flowering species, Shorea curtisii (Dipterocarpaceae), sequenced from leaves and buds collected at multiple vegetative and flowering phenological stages. We assembled 64,219 unigenes from the transcriptome of which 1,730 and 3,559 were differentially expressed in the leaf and the bud, respectively. Differentially expressed unigene clusters were found to be enriched with homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana genes associated with response to biotic and abiotic stresses, nutrient level, and hormonal treatments. When combined with rainfall data, our transcriptome data reveals that the trees were responding to a brief period of drought prior to the elevated expression of key floral promoters and followed by differential expression of unigenes that indicates physiological changes associated with the transition from vegetative to reproductive stages.

To assess whether these climatic shifts have influenced dry forest vegetation and ecosystem functioning, we integrated ground observations from a Costa Rican long-term forest dynamics monitoring plot with remotely sensed measures of forest productivity and canopy functioning from a diverse set of satellite data. Previously reported long-term climate data (1921-1997) show a reduction in annual rainfall, but since 1980 there has been no directional change in mean annual precipitation. However, the 2015 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-induced drought was unprecedented. Temperatures have increased by 1.1 degrees C since 1931. However, the Landsat wet season (1987-2017) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (canopy greenness) and the dry season (1985-2017) fraction of non-photosynthetic canopy cover all indicate that TDFs have become more deciduous but also more productive during the wet season. These changes are consistent with a shift in the functional composition observed in the long-term plot as more drought-deciduous tree species have increased in abundance. Nonetheless, more continuous 16-d MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) measures of the EVI over the past 17 yr (2001-2017) showed no change in the total annual forest productivity. Further, while the 2015 ENSO event temporarily reduced forest EVI, it did not cause a longer-term impact on forest productivity. Instead, high spatial resolution Worldview-2 satellite imagery showed that forest phenology shifted in the subsequent years even though the region returned to normal precipitation. Our results indicate that while the species composition of TDFs may be sensitive to the long-term trend of gradually increasing temperatures and aridity, the annual forest functioning has so far been resilient to long-term drying and a large episodic extreme drought event. This study demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing satellite images of different characteristics to study the vegetation dynamics of a long-term forest dynamics plot. Our synoptically sensed results show that the longer-term changing climate has been and is currently shifting the ecological functioning, and also provide a baseline to assess the impacts of an extreme drought year on TDFs.",2021-11,03/03/2025 20:51,03/03/2025 20:51,NA,,NA,11,12,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",NA,NA,NA,flowering; deciduous; ENSO; evergreen; remote sensing; Landsat; MODIS; Worldview-2,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reject,No reason given,No comments given,Insert Screener Name
