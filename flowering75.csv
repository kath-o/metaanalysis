Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of flowering phenology across an elevational gradient in the Canadian subarctic. We found that the timing of first flower was best explained by a combination of snowmelt, elevation, and growing degree-days. We also show that early flowering species have demonstrated lower intraspecific variability in their response to climate cues in comparison with late flowering species, such that individual flowering times of early species are more closely tied to environmental predictors. Previous work has suggested that early flowering species are more variable in their phenology. However, these studies have mostly examined variation in phenology over time, whereas we examined variation in phenology over space. We suggest that both patterns can be explained by the tighter coupling between phenology and climate cues for early flowering species. Thus, early flowering species have low intraspecific variance in flowering times within a single growing season as individuals respond more uniformly to a common set of cues in comparison with late flowering species. However, these same species may show large variance between years reflecting interannual variation in climate.","2014-10","2025-03-06 11:17:00","2025-03-06 11:17:00","","749-756","","10","92","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA Publisher: CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS Type: Article","","","","snowmelt; temperature sum; first flowering day; phylogenetics; variability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last few decades, snowmelt in many arctic and alpine regions has advanced, causing the growing season to start earlier and last longer. In a field experiment in subarctic tundra in Interior Alaska, I manipulated the timing of snowmelt and measured the response in mortality, phenology, growth, and reproduction of the eight dominant plant species. I then tested whether the phenological development of these species was controlled by snowmelt date or by temperature (in particular growing degree days, GDD). In order to expand our understanding of plant sensitivity to snowmelt timing, I explored whether the response patterns can be generalized with regard to the temporal niche of each species. Differences in the phenology between treatments were only found for the first stages of the phenological development (=phenophases). The earlier the temporal niche (i.e., the sooner after snowmelt a species develops) the more its phenology was sensitive to snowmelt. Later phenophases were mostly controlled by GDD, especially in late-developing species. In no species did an earlier snowmelt and a longer growing season directly enhance plant fitness or fecundity, in spite of the changes in the timing of plant development. In conclusion, the temporal niche of a species' phenological development could be a predictor of its response to snowmelt timing. However, only the first phenophases were susceptible to changes in snowmelt, and no short-term effects on plant fitness were found.","2010-03","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","53-66","","1","207","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Phenology; Reproduction; Dwarf shrub heath; Growth; Snow ecology; Winter climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adjustment between reproductive phenology and environment is expected to be higher in arctic and alpine habitats because the growing season is considerably short. As early- and late-flowering species reproduce under very different environmental conditions, selective pressures on flowering phenology and potential effects of climate change are likely to differ between them. However, there is no agreement on the magnitude of the benefits and costs of early- vs. late-flowering species under a global warming scenario. In spite of its relevance, phenotypic selection on flowering phenology has rarely been explored in alpine plants and never in Mediterranean high mountain species, where selective pressures are very different due to the summer drought imposed over the short growth season. We hypothesized that late-flowering plants in Mediterranean mountains should present stronger selective pressures towards early onset of reproduction than early-flowering species, because less water is available in the soil as growing season progresses. We performed selection analyses on flowering onset and duration in two high mountain species of contrasting phenology. Since phenotypic selection can be highly context-dependent, we studied several populations of each species for 2 years, covering their local altitudinal ranges and their different microhabitats. Surrogates of biotic selective agents, like fruitset for pollinators and flower and fruit loss for flower and seed predators, were included in the analysis. Differences between the early- and the late-flowering species were less than expected. A consistent negative correlational selection of flowering onset and duration was found affecting plant fitness, i.e., plants that bloomed earlier flowered for longer periods improving plant fitness. Nevertheless, the late-flowering species may experience higher risks under climate warming because in extremely warm and dry years the earlier season does not bring about a longer flowering duration due to summer drought.","2011-07","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","777-794","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Flowering phenology; Alpine plants; Altitudinal gradients; Phenotypic selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, warming significantly increased the temporal overlap among reproductive stages of early- and late-flowering species. In addition, we found that some species, for example the late-flowering species, were unable to produce flowers and fruits under warming with failed monsoon rains.

Here, we aim at determining the climatic factors that best explain the interannual variation in spring growth onset of alpine plants, and at examining whether photoperiod might limit their phenological response during exceptionally warm springs and early snowmelts. We analysed 17 years of data (1998-2014) from 35 automatic weather stations located in subalpine and alpine zones ranging from 1560 to 2450 m asl in the Swiss Alps. These stations are equipped with ultrasonic sensors for snow depth measurements that are also able to detect plant growth in spring and summer, giving a unique opportunity to analyse snow and climate effects on alpine plant phenology. Our analysis showed high phenological variation among years, with one exceptionally early and late spring, namely 2011 and 2013. Overall, the timing of snowmelt and the beginning of plant growth were tightly linked irrespective of the elevation of the station. Snowmelt date was the best predictor of plant growth onset with air temperature after snowmelt modulating the plants' development rate. This multiple series of alpine plant phenology suggests that currently alpine plants are directly tracking climate change with no major photoperiod limitation.","2017-02","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","349-361","","2","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Phenology; Photoperiod; Snowmelt; Alpine vegetation; Climate warming; Growth onset; Thermal time; Ultrasonic sensor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in flowering time and duration in plant communities are likely to influence plant-pollinator interactions. However, the effects of global warming on community-scale phenology have scarcely been studied in alpine ecosystems. I analyzed the flowering records of fellfield and snowbed communities collected over a nine-year period in the Taisetau Mountains of northern Japan. The flowering structure of alpine communities is composed of a flowering sequence of early-blooming fellfield species (FE), late-blooming fellfield species (FL), and snowbed species. Flowering initiation in FE showed small interannual variation, while peak flowering time was accelerated according to warmer temperature. Both the initiation and peak flowering time of FL depended on heat sum during early summer. The flowering period of fellfield communities was shortened under warmer conditions, and 1 degrees C warming thought to shorten the major flowering period by 3.8 days. The flowering initiation of snowbed plants strongly depended on snowmelt time, and the peak flowering time further advanced in warmer summers. However, the major flowering period of snowbed communities was independent of snowmelt time and thermal conditions because many snowbed species shifted flowering onset days with little changes in flowering period. As a result, the total flowering period of alpine plant communities was largely determined by snowmelt time, independent of thermal conditions. It is predicted that a 10-day earlier snowmelt will shorten the total flowering season by 4.8 days and a 10-day later snowmelt will extend the total flowering season by 5.8 days. Therefore, snowmelt regime is a major determinant factor of the flowering structure of alpine ecosystems. Clarification of snowmelt dynamics is crucial to predict the global warming impacts on the phenology of alpine ecosystems.","2020-02","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","SI","170","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","Flowering phenology; Climate change; Pollination; Temperature; Alpine plants; Snowbed; Snowmelt time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing temperatures and earlier snowmelt have already caused upward migration of species, changes in flowering phenology and increasing frost damage in plants. Thus, significant loss of diversity in alpine areas is imminent. Plant migration and distribution shifts occur mainly via seeds, which also provide the genetic diversity required for adaptation. The ability of plants to shift their distribution in response to climate change will depend on seed dispersal, germination and seedling success under new environmental conditions. Despite the critical importance of seeds and seedlings for species adaptation, migration and persistence, the majority of studies concerning climate change in alpine areas have mostly focused on the response of adult plants to warming. Temperature during seed development, as well as the temperature to which seeds are exposed post-dispersal, has been found to have strong effects on seed longevity, germination and seedling survival. Therefore, global change (particularly, warming) is expected to greatly impact regeneration of seeds in alpine areas. Despite evidence that climate change is advancing flowering phenology in several mountain ranges around the world, under natural and artificial warming, the cascade effects that early flowering can have on seeds and seedlings have been poorly studied. Indeed, while a literature search on Web of Science using the search terms “germination”, “alpine plants” and “climate change” revealed 50 studies, of which only 7 directly examined the effect of warming on germination and establishment of seeds of alpine plant species. Here, we discuss the findings of these studies. We identify critical questions regarding seeds and seedlings of alpine species that require urgent research and recommend experimental approaches. Answering these questions will assist in predicting the impacts of global warming and in conservation and management of plants in alpine areas.","2015-10","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","59-68","","2","125","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND Publisher: SPRINGER BASEL AG Type: Article","","","","Climate change; Alpine areas; Early snowmelt; Germination phenology; Seedlings; Seeds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although changes in flowering phenology among species under climate change have been reported widely, how species-specific shifts will affect phenological synchrony and community-level phenology patterns remains unclear. We conducted a manipulative experiment of warming and precipitation addition and reduction to explore how climate change affected flowering phenology at the species and community levels in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We found that warming advanced the first and last flowering times differently and with no consistent shifts in flowering duration among species, resulting in the entire flowering period of species emerging earlier in the growing season. Early-flowering species were more sensitive to warming than mid- and late-flowering species, thereby reducing flowering synchrony among species and extending the community-level flowering season. However, precipitation and its interactions with warming had no significant effects on flowering phenology. Our results suggest that temperature regulates flowering phenology from the species to community levels in this alpine meadow community, yet how species shifted their flowering timing and duration in response to warming varied. This species-level divergence may reshape flowering phenology in this alpine plant community. Decreasing flowering synchrony among species and the extension of community-level flowering seasons under warming may alter future trophic interactions, with cascading consequences to community and ecosystem function.","2023-01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","1","104","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","flowering phenology; synchrony; warming; precipitation changes; alpine meadow; functional group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiment was run at one subarctic site and one alpine site for 2 years and 1 year, respectively, using open-top chambers (OTC). The 2-year temperature enhancement at the subarctic site had a marked effect on the flowering phenology. Cushions inside the OTC started flowering substantially earlier than control cushions. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs, and maturation of capsules occurred earlier. The cushions also responded positively in reproductive terms and produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio.

The timing of flowering and fruiting (phenology) is often temperature dependent and tends to advance as the climate warms. Herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations can provide historical phenology records and have been used, on a localised scale, to predict species' phenological sensitivity to climate change. Conducting similar localised studies in the Canadian Arctic, however, poses a challenge where the collection of herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations have been temporally and spatially sporadic. We used flowering and seed dispersal times of 23 Arctic species from herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations collected from across the 2.1million km(2) area of Nunavut, Canada, to determine (1) which monthly temperatures influence flowering and seed dispersal times; (2) species' phenological sensitivity to temperature; and (3) whether flowering or seed dispersal times have advanced over the past 120years. We tested this at different spatial scales and compared the sensitivity in different regions of Nunavut. Broadly speaking, this research serves as a proof of concept to assess whether phenology-climate change studies using historic data can be conducted at large spatial scales. Flowering times and seed dispersal time were most strongly correlated with June and July temperatures, respectively. Seed dispersal times have advanced at double the rate of flowering times over the past 120years, reflecting greater late-summer temperature rises in Nunavut. There is great diversity in the flowering time sensitivity to temperature of Arctic plant species, suggesting climate change implications for Arctic ecological communities, including altered community composition, competition, and pollinator interactions. Intraspecific temperature sensitivity and warming trends varied markedly across Nunavut and could result in greater changes in some parts of Nunavut than in others.","2017-03","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1325-1338","","5","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; herbarium specimen; flowering time; Arctic; Nunavut; seed dispersal time; temperature sensitivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Presently, the warming is pushing forward snowmelt timing which may influence species' seasonal cycle throughout the alpine landscape of Himalaya. Nevertheless, very few studies have studied the response of species' phenology to advanced snowmelt in the Himalayas. The present study investigated different alpine species' responses to early snowmelt present in different alpine communities. Five communities were identified and two sites were selected in each community (early snowmelt: ES, late snowmelt: LS) with a 50 x 50 m plot marked permanently for species monitoring. The observations for phenophase initiation and durations of all species were recorded fortnightly. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to examine species-specific differences in phenophase durations. Pairwise differences were tested with Dunn's post hoc test. The present study hypothesized early snowmelt advances and lengthens phenophases timing and duration in all alpine species. The results showed that phenophases initiations and duration were earlier and longer in ES sites for the majority of species but no significant relationship was found between snowmelt timing and species' phenophase duration. Many species showed two distinctive phenophases (reproductive and fruiting). The divergence was higher in the reproductive phenophase than in other phenological stages. Hence, it seems that the early snowmelt is an important driver influencing the early spring phenology of herb species, the species-specific effects of already happening phenological adjustment for higher reproductive success in the current warming of alpine meadows points towards other limiting factors too that remain to be better understood.","2023-12","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1041-1054","","4","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAIXA POSTAL 57088, SAO PAULO, SP 00000, BRAZIL Publisher: SOC BOTANICA SAO PAULO Type: Article","","","","Climate change; Phenophase; Himalaya; Treeline; Growth forms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A long-term monitoring of snowmelt regimes in a Japanese alpine area revealed that the onset of the snowmelt season has been accelerated during the last 17 years in early snowmelt sites but that such a trend has not been detected in late snowmelt sites. This indicates that the global warming effect on the snowmelt pattern may be site-specific. The flowering phenology of fellfield plants in an exposed wind-blown habitat was consistent between an unusually warm year (1998) and a normal year (2001). In contrast, the flowering occurrence of snowbed plants varied greatly between the years depending on the snowmelt time. There was a large number of flowering species in the fellfield community from mid- to late to late June and from mid- to late July. The flowering peak of an early-melt snowbed plant community was in the middle of the flowering season and that of a late-melt snowbed community was in the early flowering season. These habitat-specific phenological patterns were consistent between 1998 and 2001. The effects of the variation in flowering timing on seed-set success were evaluated for an entomophilous snowbed herb, Peucedanum multivittatum, along the snowmelt gradient during a 5-year period. When flowering occurred prior to early August, mean temperature during the flowering season positively influenced the seed set. When flowering occurred later than early August, however, the plants enjoyed high seed-set success irrespective of temperature conditions if frost damage was absent. These observations are probably explained based on the availability of pollinators, which depends not only on ambient temperature but also on seasonal progress. These results suggest that the effects of climate change on biological interaction may vary depending on the specific habitat in the alpine ecosystem in which diverse snowmelt patterns create complicated seasonality for plants within a very localized area.","2006-01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","49-58","","1","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Soc Populat Ecol Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article; Proceedings Paper","","","","flowering phenology; global warming; alpine plants; seed production; snowmelt time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rate of temperature change is especially high in the Arctic, but this is also where we have relatively little data on phenological changes and the processes driving these changes. In order to understand how Arctic plant species are likely to respond to future changes in climate, we monitored flowering phenology in response to both experimental and ambient warming for four widespread species in two habitat types over 21years. We additionally used long-term environmental records to disentangle the effects of temperature increase and changes in snowmelt date on phenological patterns. While flowering occurred earlier in response to experimental warming, plants in unmanipulated plots showed no change or a delay in flowering over the 21-year period, despite more than 1 degrees C of ambient warming during that time. This counterintuitive result was likely due to significantly delayed snowmelt over the study period (0.05-0.2days/yr) due to increased winter snowfall. The timing of snowmelt was a strong driver of flowering phenology for all species - especially for early-flowering species - while spring temperature was significantly related to flowering time only for later-flowering species. Despite significantly delayed flowering phenology, the timing of seed maturation showed no significant change over time, suggesting that warmer temperatures may promote more rapid seed development. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the specific environmental cues that drive species' phenological responses as well as the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation when forecasting phenology over the coming decades. As demonstrated here, the effects of altered snowmelt patterns can counter the effects of warmer temperatures, even to the point of generating phenological responses opposite to those predicted by warming alone.","2015-12","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","4651-4661","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; plant phenology; flowering time; Arctic tundra; Bayesian hierarchical modeling; interval censoring; seed maturation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alpine plant communities have already experienced serious impacts, and will continue to do so as climate change continues. The aim of our study was to determine the sensitivity of woody and herbaceous species to shifts in temperature along an altitudinal gradient. Since 1994, park rangers have been making phenological observations at 24 sites from 680 to 1425 m a.s.l. Each year 21 plant species were observed once or twice weekly from March to July; with a main focus on flowering and leaf unfolding. Our study showed a very high degree of dependence of phenophases and species on inter-annual temperature variation and altitude. Averaged over all species and phenophases, there was a delay of 3.8 days with every 100 m increase in altitude and, across all elevations, an advance of phenophases of 6 days per 1 degrees C increase in temperature. Temperature lapse rates assessed indirectly by phenology, as the quotient of altitudinal to temperature response coefficients, were higher than directly calculated from March to July mean temperatures, most likely due to snow effects. Furthermore, a significant difference in sensitivity to temperature change was found between growth forms (herbs versus trees). Sensitivity was less pronounced in events occurring later in the season. Our results show that species reactions will differ in magnitude during global warming. Consequently, impacts of shifts in the timing of phenological events on plant migration and plant-pollinator interactions due to rising temperatures should be considered at the species level.","2013-01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","57-69","","1, SI","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","phenology; growth forms; trees; Alps; herbs; sensitivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, while taller shrub communities are expanding, dwarf shrub communities show reductions under climate warming, and the mechanisms driving the latter (such as warming temperatures or accelerated spring snowmelt) may be complex. To determine and disentangle the response of a widespread arctic-alpine prostrate dwarf shrub to both climate warming and changes in snowmelt time, we investigated phenology, clonal and sexual reproduction, leaf size, wood tissue carbon balance and leaf damage in 480 patches of Salix herbacea, along its elevational and snowmelt microhabitat range over 3years in a space-for-time substitution. Earlier snowmelt was associated with longer phenological development periods, an increased likelihood of herbivory and fungal damage, lower stem density, smaller leaves and lower end-of-season wood reserve carbohydrates. Furthermore, while early snowmelt was associated with an increased proportion of flowering stems, the proportion of fruiting stems was not, as fruit set decreased significantly with earlier snowmelt. Warmer temperatures at lower elevations were associated with lower stem numbers and larger leaves.Synthesis. Our study indicates that phenology, fitness proxies and fungal/insect damage of the dwarf shrub S.herbacea are strongly influenced by snowmelt timing, and that earlier spring snowmelt reduced performance in S.herbacea. The likely mechanisms for many of the observed patterns are related to adverse temperature conditions in the early growing season. Reductions in clonal (stem number) and sexual reproduction (reduced fruit set) under earlier snowmelt, in addition to increasing damage probability, will likely lead to lower fitness and poorer performance, particularly in shrubs growing in early-exposure microhabitats. Further, we saw few concurrent benefits of higher temperatures for S.herbacea, particularly as warming was associated with lower clonal growth. As growing seasons become warmer and longer in arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems, early snowmelt is a critical mechanism reducing fitness and performance in a widespread dwarf shrub and may ultimately reduce dwarf shrub communities in tundra biomes.","2016-07","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1041-1050","","4","104","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; flowering; plant-climate interactions; phenology; herbivory; clonal reproduction; dwarf shrub; early snowmelt; non-structural carbohydrates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the effects of a six-year experimental soil warming treatment (+4 degrees C, 2007-2012) on the phenology and growth of three co-dominant dwarf shrub species growing in the understory of Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata at treeline in the Swiss Alps. We monitored vegetative and reproductive phenology of Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium gaultherioides and Empetrum hermaphroditum throughout the early growing season of 2012 and, following a major harvest at peak season, we measured the biomass of above-ground ramet fractions. For all six years of soil warming we measured annual shoot growth of the three species and analyzed ramet age and xylem ring width of V. myrtillus. Our results show that phenology of the three species was more influenced by snowmelt timing, and also by plot tree species (Larix or Pinus) in the case of V. myrtillus, than by soil warming. However, the warming treatment led to increased V. myrtillus total above-ground ramet biomass (+36% in 2012), especially new shoot biomass (+63% in 2012), as well as increased new shoot increment length and xylem ring width (+22% and +41%, respectively; average for 2007-2012). These results indicate enhanced overall growth of V. myrtillus under soil warming that was sustained over six years and was not caused by an extended growing period in early summer. In contrast, E. hermaphroditum only showed a positive shoot growth response to warming in 2011 (+21%), and V. gaultherioides showed no significant growth response. Our results indicate that V. myrtillus might have a competitive advantage over the less responsive co-occurring dwarf shrub species under future global warming.","2014-06-23","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","6","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA Publisher: PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Arctic is experiencing particularly rapid warming, but long-term data on phenological changes are rare in this region, especially for arthropods-a diverse taxonomic group that form important links to other trophic levels. Understanding the environmental drivers of arthropod phenological variation is necessary for predicting future trends across taxa and habitats to climate change. Here, we analyze temporal trends and climate associations in arthropod phenology using 25 years of standardized monitoring data from four habitat types in high-Arctic Greenland. We observed earlier peak activity in the arthropod community, with responses varying considerably among families and habitats. Snowmelt timing was a key driver of peak activity, especially for late-active taxa, while temperature was a less important driver, but arthropods generally exhibited earlier activity with warming. Responses in the duration of activity were more complex, with family- and habitat-specific responses to climate variation. Notably, taxa in habitats with late snowmelt responded strongly to snowmelt timing, while those in the pond habitat responded strongly to temperature. Mixed feeders and parasitoids showed rapid peak phenological shifts to earlier snowmelt and warming; however, mixed feeders shortened their activity periods, while parasitoids extended theirs. Our findings highlight the complexity of arthropod community phenological responses to climate change, with potential implications for trophic interactions dependent on temporal overlap. By analyzing phenological metrics across entire activity seasons for taxa with different functional and life-history traits, we identify general trends and consistent patterns that enhance our understanding of arthropod responses to climate change.","2025-02","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","1","95","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; temperature; phenology; snowmelt; arthropods; high-Arctic; long-term monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This limits our ability to predict responses to climate change by plant species and communities. To address this gap, we used infrared heaters and manual watering in a fully factorial experiment to determine the relative importance of these climate factors on plant flowering phenology, and response differences among plant functional groups. Heating advanced snowmelt and flower initiation, but exposed plants to colder early-spring conditions in the period prior to first flower, indicating that snowmelt timing, not temperature, advances flowering initiation in the alpine community. Flowering duration was largely conserved; heating did not extend average species flowering into the latter part of the growing season but instead flowering was completed earlier in heated plots. Although passive warming experiments have resulted in warming-induced soil drying suggested to advance flower senescence, supplemental water did not counteract the average species advance in flowering senescence caused by heating or extend flowering in unheated plots, and variation in soil moisture had inconsistent effects on flowering periods. Functional groups differed in sensitivity to earlier snowmelt, with flower initiation most advanced for early-season species and flowering duration lengthened only for graminoids and forbs. We conclude that earlier snowmelt, driven by increased radiative heating, is the most important factor altering alpine flowering phenology. Studies that only manipulate summer temperature will err in estimating the sensitivity of alpine flowering phenology to large-scale warming. The wholesale advance in flowering phenology with earlier snowmelt suggests that alpine communities will track warming, but only alpine forbs and graminoids appear able to take advantage of an extended snow-free season.","2020-09","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","9","101","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; phenology; flowering duration; soil moisture; active heating; advanced snowmelt; alpine plant community; experimental climate warming; flower initiation; flower senescence; infrared heat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present results of a field experiment to test the hypotheses that (1) the timing of phenological events does not necessarily delay as elevation increases; (2) changes in the timing of a sequence of phenological events will be consistent for all phenological events along the elevation gradient; and thus (3) change in the timing of phenological events does not affect the duration of the entire reproductive stage in the alpine region. The experiment was conducted along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 3800 m using two early-spring flowering (ESF) sedges and four mid-summer flowering (MSF) plants (two forbs and two grasses). Generally, our results only supported the first hypothesis. Lower elevation delayed the starting dates of all phenological events for ESF plants at 3200 m compared with other elevations, whereas the opposite trend was observed for MSF-grasses. MSF-forbs had the earliest leaf-out at 3200 m and the earliest first flowering at 3600 m, and onset of fruit-set advanced with increasing elevation. The entire reproductive duration was shortened with increasing elevation for MSF-forbs, whereas it was the shortest for ESF at 3600 m and for MSF-grasses at 3200 and/or 3800 m. Individual reproductive stages had independent responses to climate change. The duration of the entire growing season for ESF plants decreased as elevation increased. For MSF-forbs, it was longest at 3200 m and shortest at 3400 m, while for MSF-grasses it was shortest at 3200 m and at 3800 m. Reproduction was compressed into shorter time periods only for MSF-forbs at 3600 and 3800 m. Therefore, reproduction is not tightly integrated across the life cycle, and earlier reproductive development induced by warmer spring temperatures did not consistently advance flowering and fruiting times and their durations for the alpine plants studied. The effects of climate change on the timing and duration of phenological events were species-specific. Selection for changes in the timing and duration of individual phenological stages in response to climate change due to evolutionary adaptation should be taken into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Concurrently, they risk the loss of reproductive efforts to late frosts. Quantifying long-term trends in northeastern alpine flower phenology and late-spring/early-summer frost risk is limited by a dearth of phenology and climate data, except for Mount Washington, New Hampshire (1916 m a.s.l.). Methods: Logistic phenology models for three northeastern US alpine species (Diapensia lapponica, Carex bigelowii and Vaccinium vitis-idaea) were developed from 4 yr (2008-2011) of phenology and air temperature measurements from 12 plots proximate to Mount Washington's long-term summit meteorological station. Plot-level air temperature, the logistic phenology models, and Mount Washington's climate data were used to hindcast model yearly (1935-2011) floral phenology and frost damage risk for the focal species. Key results: Day of year and air growing degree-days with threshold temperatures of -4 degrees C (D. lapponica and C. bigelowii) and -2 degrees C (V. vitis-idaea) best predicted flowering. Modeled historic flowering dates trended significantly earlier but the 77-yr change was small (1.2-2.1 d) and did not significantly increase early-flowering risk from late-spring/early-summer frost damage. Conclusions: Modeled trends in phenological advancement and sensitivity for three northeastern alpine species are less pronounced compared with lower elevations in the region, and this small shift in flower timing did not increase risk of frost damage. Potential reasons for limited earlier phenological advancement at higher elevations include a slower warming trend and increased cloud exposure with elevation and/or inadequate chilling requirements.","2014-09","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1437-1446","","9","101","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; alpine plants; Carex bigelowii; Diapensia lapponica; floral phenology; frost risk; long-term record; Mount Washington; New Hampshire; Vaccinium vitis-idaea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Responses may occur by range shifts, phenological adjustments in growth and reproduction, or both. Here, we compare distribution and phenology of 83 arctic and boreal mountain species, sampled identically in the early 20th (1917-1919) and 21st centuries (2017-2018) from a region of northern Sweden that has warmed significantly. We test two compensatory hypotheses to high-latitude warming-upward shifts in distribution, and earlier or extended growth and reproduction. For distribution, we show dramatic upward migration by 69% of species, averaging 6.1 m per decade, especially boreal woodland taxa whose upward expansion has reduced arctic montane habitat by 30%. Twenty percent of summit species showed distributional shifts but downward, especially moisture-associated snowbed flora. For phenology, we detected wide inter-annual variability in the onset of leafing and flowering in both eras. However, there was no detectable change in growing-season length, relating to two mechanisms. First, plot-level snow melt data starting in 1917 demonstrated that melt date, rather than vernal temperatures, better predicts plant emergence, with snow melt influenced by warmer years having greater snowfall-warmer springs did not always result in earlier emergence because snowbeds can persist longer. Second, the onset of reproductive senescence between eras was similar, even when plant emergence was earlier by a month, possibly due to intensified summer heat stress or hard-wired `canalization' where senescence occurs regardless of summer temperature. Migrations in this system have possibly buffered arctic species against displacement by boreal expansion and warming, but ongoing temperature increases, woody plant invasion, and a potential lack of flexibility in timing of senescence may foreshadow challenges.","2021-10","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","5070-5083","","20","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; phenology; mountain; arctic flora; historical data; migration; resiliency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Arctic, rapid phenological changes in many taxa are occurring in association with earlier snowmelt. The timing of snowmelt is jointly affected by the size of the late winter snowpack and the temperature during the spring thaw. Increased winter snowpack results in delayed snowmelt, whereas higher air temperatures and faster snowmelt advance the timing of snowmelt. Where interannual variation in snowpack is substantial, changes in the timing of snowmelt can be largely uncoupled from changes in air temperature. Using detailed, long-term data on the flowering phenology of four arctic plant species from Zackenberg, Greenland, we investigate whether there is a phenological component to the temperature conditions experienced prior to and during flowering. In particular, we assess the role of timing of flowering in determining pre-flowering exposure to freezing temperatures and to the temperatures experienced prior to flowering. We then examine the implications of flowering phenology for flower abundance. Earlier snowmelt resulted in greater exposure to freezing conditions, suggesting an increased potential for a mismatch between the timing of flowering and seasonal weather conditions and an increased potential for negative consequences, such as freezing damage. We also found a parabolic relationship between the timing of flowering and the temperature experienced during flowering after taking interannual temperature effects into account. If timing of flowering advances to a cooler period of the growing season, this may moderate the effects of a general warming trend across years. Flower abundance was quadratically associated with the timing of flowering, such that both early and late flowering led to lower flower abundance than did intermediate flowering. Our results indicate that shifting the timing of flowering affects the temperature experienced during flower development and flowering beyond that imposed by interannual variations in climate. We also found that phenological timing may affect flower abundance, and hence, fitness. These findings suggest that plant population responses to future climate change will be shaped not only by extrinsic climate forcing, but also by species' phenological responses.","2015-03","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","775-787","","3","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; flowering; phenology; snowmelt; interannual variability; Cassiope tetragona; climatic mismatch; Dryas octopetala; Greenland; Huisman-Olff-Fresco models; integrifolia; Papaver radicatum; Salix arctica; Zackenberg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this, some species initiate flowering late in the season, but little work has been done on the reproductive ecology of such species. This work investigates the reproductive consequences of late flowering in Leontodon autumnalis var. taraxaci in alpine southwest Norway during two seasons. In addition, the effects of an experimental increase in growing-season temperature on growth and reproduction are also examined. The reproductive success of Leontodon decreased strongly as the flowering season progressed, possibly as a result of increased climatic severity and increased extent of pollen and resource limitation on reproduction. Experimentally warmed plants produced significantly more and heavier seeds, and flowered more than 1 wk earlier than control plants, showing that temperature conditions influence both reproductive processes and flowering phenology. The results suggest that this late-flowering alpine species will bloom earlier, reproduce more, and grow larger under global warming.","1997-08","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","285-290","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: UNIV COLORADO, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA Publisher: INST ARCTIC ALPINE RES Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the advancement of green up and flowering are well-documented, it remains unclear whether all phenophases, particularly those later in the season, will shift in unison or respond divergently to warming. Here, we present the largest synthesis to our knowledge of experimental warming effects on tundra plant phenology from the International Tundra Experiment. We examine the effect of warming on a suite of season-wide plant phenophases. Results challenge the expectation that all phenophases will advance in unison to warming. Instead, we find that experimental warming caused: (1) larger phenological shifts in reproductive versus vegetative phenophases and (2) advanced reproductive phenophases and green up but delayed leaf senescence which translated to a lengthening of the growing season by approximately 3%. Patterns were consistent across sites, plant species and over time. The advancement of reproductive seasons and lengthening of growing seasons may have significant consequences for trophic interactions and ecosystem function across the tundra. It is unclear whether climate driven phenological shifts of tundra plants are consistent across the plant growing season. Here the authors analyse data from a network of field warming experiments in Arctic and alpine tundra, finding that warming differentially affects the timing and duration of reproductive and vegetative phenology.","2021-06-11","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY Publisher: NATURE PORTFOLIO Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies in many ecosystems have focussed on competition; however, facilitation has often been found to outweigh competition under harsh environmental conditions. The balance between positive and negative species interactions is known to shift along spatial, temporal and environmental gradients and thus is likely to be affected by climate change. Winter temperature and precipitation patterns in Interior Alaska are rapidly changing and could lead to warmer winters with a shallow, early melting snow cover in the near future. We conducted snow manipulation and neighbour removal experiments to test whether the relative importance of positive and negative species interactions differs between three winter climate scenarios in a subarctic tundra community. In plots with ambient, manually advanced or delayed snowmelt, we assessed the relative importance of neighbours for survival, phenology, growth and reproduction of two dwarf shrub species. Under ambient conditions and after delayed snowmelt, positive and negative neighbour effects were generally balanced, but when snowmelt was advanced we found overall facilitative neighbour effects on survival, phenology, growth and reproduction of Empetrum nigrum, the earlier developing of the two target species. As earlier snowmelt was correlated with colder spring temperatures and a higher number of frosts, we conclude that plants experienced harsher environmental conditions after early snowmelt and that neighbours could have played an important role in ameliorating the physical environment at the beginning of the growing season.","2006-08","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1496-1506","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","phenology; reproduction; growth; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; dwarf shrub heath; Empetrum nigrum; facilitation; neighbour removal experiment; winter climate change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In alpine ecosystems, where snowmelt timing is a key driver of phenology, earlier snowmelt may generate shifts in plant and pollinator phenology that vary across the landscape, potentially disrupting interactions. Here we ask how experimental advancement of snowmelt timing in a topographically heterogeneous alpine-subalpine landscape impacts flowering, insect pollinator visitation, and pathways connecting key predictors of plant-pollinator interaction. Snowmelt was advanced by an average of 13.5 days in three sites via the application of black sand over snow in manipulated plots, which were paired with control plots. For each forb species, we documented flowering onset and counted flowers throughout the season. We also performed pollinator observations to measure visitation rates. The majority (79.3%) of flower visits were made by dipteran insects. We found that plants flowered earlier in advanced snowmelt plots, with the largest advances in later-flowering species, but flowering duration and visitation rate did not differ between advanced snowmelt and control plots. Using piecewise structural equation models, we assessed the interactive effects of topography on snowmelt timing, flowering phenology, floral abundance, and pollinator visitation. We found that these factors interacted to predict visitation rate in control plots. However, in plots with experimentally advanced snowmelt, none of these predictors explained a significant amount of variation in visitation rate, indicating that different predictors are needed to understand the processes that directly influence pollinator visitation to flowers under future climate conditions. Our findings demonstrate that climate change-induced early snowmelt may fundamentally disrupt the predictive relationships among abiotic and biotic drivers of plant-pollinator interactions in subalpine-alpine environments.","2024-10","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","141-150","","2, SI","134","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND Publisher: SPRINGER BASEL AG Type: Article","","","","Climate change; Flowering time; Plant-pollinator interactions; Topography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We leverage an unusual long-term dataset with repeated, individual measurements of phenology and reproduction in a long-lived alpine plant. We analyze phenotypic plasticity in flowering phenology in relation to two climate drivers, snowmelt timing and growing degree days (GDDs). Plants flower earlier with increased GDDs and earlier snowmelt, and directional selection also favors earlier flowering under these conditions. However, reproduction still declines with warming and early snowmelt, even when flowering is early. Furthermore, the steepness of this reproductive decline increases dramatically with warming conditions, resulting in very little fruit production regardless of flowering time once GDDs exceed approximately 225 degree days or snowmelt occurs before May 15. Even though advancing phenology confers a fitness advantage relative to stasis, these shifts are insufficient to maintain reproduction under warming, highlighting limits to the potential benefits of phenological plasticity under climate change.","2024-05-01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","E157-E174","","5","203","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA Publisher: UNIV CHICAGO PRESS Type: Article","","","","climate change; phenology; fitness landscape; plasticity; selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To clarify flowering phenological changes, we collected 1646 ground-observed phenological records of 21 species, from 27 stations, for 78 time series, and daily average air temperature data from 1983 to 2017 on the QTP. Trends in the first flowering date (FFD) and changes with temperature increase were analyzed using regression models. The FFD of early flowering time series showed an overall trend for significant advance (-0.371 +/- 0.149 days/year, p < 0.001), whereas the mid-to-late-flowering showed a delayed trend (0.158 +/- 0.193 days/year, p = 0.108). This finding is in contrast with the stable trend for early flowering species and the advanced trend for midsummer and late-flowering species in high latitude and Arctic regions, where the low-temperature environment is similar. The growing degree days from 1 January to the day of the observed occurrence of the FFD for early flowering time series kept stable (p = 0.531) and FFD showed a positive regression with chilling days; however, the growing degree days of mid-to-late-flowering time series increased significantly at a rate of 5.375 +/- 2.519 degrees C-days/year (p < 0.001), indicating the limitation on FFD from other related climatic factors except for forcing temperature may strengthen, and FFD showed no relationship with chilling days. The mid-tolate-flowering time series showed vernalization sensitivity in the spring of the flowering year, whereas the early flowering time series did not. This indicated that retarded vernalization completion may be responsible for the delayed flowering phenology of mid-to-late-flowering species. The FFD of early flowering species, with flower preformation in the preceding autumn, was mainly controlled by forcing temperature in spring; decreased chilling days indicating warmer winter were also beneficial for development and fitness of preformed floral organs, and thus, temperature increase significantly advanced the FFD. These findings suggest that divergent flowering phenology shifts may alter the species composition and ecosystem services of alpine ecosystems, causing challenges in grassland management.","2021-09-15","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","","307","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article","","","","Flowering phenology; Global warming; Flower preformation; Herbaceous plants; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Vernalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a growing realization that herbarium-based collections could offer a reliable and relatively time-saving baseline data source to identify these effects. This article examines the magnitude and trends of warming effects on the average flowering timing (AFT) of plants in Tibet Autonomous Region using analysis of herbarium specimens collected for 4 decades. Mixed model with randomized blocks was used to analyze a set of 41 species (total 909 specimens) which were collected during the period of 1961-2000. Results showed that an earlier AFT emerged within 40 years period in comparison to the recorded data of the year of 2000 (0.5 days per year), and that 7.5 days early flowering was contributed by mean summer (i.e., June-August) temperature. It is proposed that temporary shifts in flowering phenology responding to continuing temperature rise could quantify the extent to which climate affects plant species. Analysis of well recorded herbarium specimens could provide a reasonable indication on the impacts of rising temperature on plant phenology. The result of this study could also facilitate a bridge between the scientific knowledge and indigenous knowledge of Tibetan communities.","2013-01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","141-152","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Flowering phenology; Climate warming; Herbarium specimens; Mixed model; Tibet autonomous region","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, empirical evidence linking specific aspects of plant flowering phenology to the number of flowers produced is limited, particularly under future global climate change. We used phenology measurements after 2, 3, 6, and 7 years of a fully factorial, climate change field experiment in an alpine meadow pasture on the central Tibetan Plateau to understand: 1) how experimental warming and snow addition affect the date of first and last flowering in related forb and shrub species, Potentilla saundersiana Royle and Potentilla fruticosa L.; and 2) how these changes in the timing of phenological events alter flowering duration and production, as a proxy for reproductive effort. We found that warming significantly advanced the date of first flowering in both P. fruticosa and P. saundersiana, with no other significant effects on flowering duration or production. In contrast to warming, simulated snowstorms delayed the date of first flowering in P. saundersiana, but had no significant effect on P. fruticosa. There were no significant treatment interactions. For both species, flower production increased as the last date of flowering occurred later. These results indicate that as climate change alters alpine plant phenology, advances in the timing of first flowering alone will not necessarily translate to increases in flowering duration and enhanced reproductive effort. Instead, these findings demonstrate the importance of the date of last flowering in mediating plant reproductive effort and success.","2020-04-01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","","291","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article","","","","Seasonality; Alpine; Climate warming; OTCs; Shrub; Snow manipulation; Tibetan Plateau","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In alpine regions the temperature rise has been especially pronounced and together with decreasing winter precipitation has led to earlier snowmelt. The close association between time of snowmelt and plant growth at high elevations makes climate change for alpine plants particularly threatening. Here we transplanted eleven congeneric pairs of high- and low-elevation herbaceous species to common gardens differing c. 800 m in elevation, and c. 4 degrees C in mean growing season temperature to test whether reproductive phenologies of high- and low-elevation plants differ in their respective responses to temperature. Results indicate that high-elevation plants were less plastic in response to transplantation than their low-elevation congeners as the onsets of phenophases on average shifted 7 days less than in low-elevation plants. Plasticity of phenophase durations was overall weaker than that of phenophase onsets, and slightly stronger in high-elevation species compared to low-elevation congeners. We suggest that weaker plasticity in the onsets of early stages of reproductive phenology of high-elevation plants is related to spring frost, which constitutes a strong selective agent against early loss of winter hardiness. Some of the plastic responses of both low- and high-elevation species might potentially be adaptive under predicted climate change. However, the observed plasticity can be largely explained as a passive response to temperature and not as the result of natural selection in heterogeneous environments. The strong temperature-sensitivity of low-elevation species might promote their upward range expansion, but only to a certain threshold after which it becomes limited by the short growing season.

A three-year reciprocal translocation experiment was performed along an elevation gradient from 3200 m to 3800 m in the Tibetan Plateau for six alpine plants. Transplanting to lower elevation (warming) advanced the first flowering date (FFD) and transplanting to higher elevation (cooling) had the opposite effect. The FFD of early spring flowering plants (ESF) was four times less sensitive to warming than to cooling (by -2.1 d/degrees C and 8.4 d/degrees C, respectively), while midsummer flowering plants (MSF) were about twice as sensitive to warming than to cooling (-8.0 d/degrees C and 4.9 d/degrees C, respectively). Compared with pooled warming and cooling data, warming alone significantly underpredicted 3.1 d/degrees C for ESF and overestimated 1.7 d/degrees C for MSF. These results suggest that future empirical and experimental studies should consider nonlinear temperature responses that can cause such warming-cooling asymmetries as well as differing life strategies (ESF vs. MSF) among plant species.","2014-12","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","3387-3398","","12","95","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA Publisher: ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER Type: Article","","","","first flowering date; global warming; temperature sensitivity; Tibetan Plateau; early spring flowering; midsummer flowering; warming and cooling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because flowering period of alpine plants varies highly depending on snowmelt conditions, the effects of phenological variation on fruit-set success may vary among local populations. I observed the relationship between flowering time and fruit-set success in four populations of a bee-pollinated dwarf shrub, Rhododendron aureum, located in fellfield and snowbed habitats in northern Japan, for 12 or 13 years over the 25 years from 1995 to 2019. Flowering of the fellfield populations usually occurred in June, and flowering of the snowbed populations commonly started after mid-July, although there was considerable yearly variation in actual flowering time within individual populations. Generally, the fruit-set rates of the fellfield populations were low, with large yearly fluctuations, whereas those of the snowbed populations were stable and high. There was a clear trend toward a decrease in fruit-set rates with earlier flowering in the fellfield populations due to pollen limitation and occasional frost damage. The risk of frost damage increased with earlier flowering in the fellfield habitat. These results indicate that the effects of climate change on fruit-set success of alpine plants are strongly site-specific and are greatest early in the growing season.","2021-04","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","53-62","","1","131","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND Publisher: SPRINGER BASEL AG Type: Article","","","","Global warming; Temperature; Fellfield; Frost damage; Snowbed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a 7-year field warming and altered precipitation experiment initiated in 2017, we measured three reproductive phenological events and seven reproductive traits of six dominant species, belonging to two flowering functional groups, to assess the effects of climate change on reproductive phenology and the reproductive consequence of changing the phenology in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau from 2021 to 2023. Warming significantly advanced the start of flowering in early-spring flowering (ESF) and mid-summer flowering (MSF) plants, while the fruiting period of ESF plants remained stable. Furthermore, warming led to a decrease in the number of seeds and productivity of alpine plants, while seed size remained stable. Phenological changes regulate the reproductive success of alpine plants. Specifically, the start of flowering for ESF plants and the start of fruiting for MSF plants regulated the number of seeds and productivity of the two flowering functional groups, respectively. The increase in phenological niche overlap and intensification of interspecific competition, caused by different phenological responses of the flowering functional groups to warming, also are key factors contributing to the decline in seed production of alpine plants. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that the reproductive success of alpine plants would be decreased by earlier reproduction under climate warming, and alpine plants tend to maintain stable seed size in response to climate change.

An 11-year study of 75 species in the central highland of Iceland showed that the onset of flowering varies greatly among years. The number of species in flower by the first week of July was closely correlated with air temperature (degree days above zero) in the preceding 5 weeks, but no correlations were found with degree days in May or with total degree days in the previous growing season. Time of snowmelt, which has widely been regarded as the environmental event initiating growth and flowering in alpine and arctic tundra, only had a significant effect when two exceptionally cold and late summers were included. The species studied, most of which have a wide distribution in the Arctic, are predicted to respond quickly to warmer spring and early summer temperatures. Accelerated phenologies may alter patterns of resource allocation, have implications for pollinators and pollinator-competition, and could increase the size, species richness and intraspecific genetic diversity of the soil seed bank.","1998-03","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","43-49","","1","114","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","flowering phenology; global warming; Arctic; Iceland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we explore the changes in timing and duration of the community phenological sequence (i.e. onset of leaf-out (OLO), first flower bud (FB), first flowering (FF), first fruiting-set (FFS), post-fruiting vegetation (OPFV), first leaf-coloring (FLC) and complete leaf-coloring (CLC)) along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 3800 m in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau. Our results indicate that OLO and FFS significantly advanced and other timings of phenological events significantly delayed at 3200 m compared with higher elevations (3600 and 3800 m). The flowering duration of the community was shortest and other phenological durations (except budding stage and post-fruiting vegetation stage) were longest at 3200 m. The duration of the growing season decreased as elevation increased, and the ratio of the durations of the reproductive period and growing season was smallest at 3200 m. There were negative correlations between the proportion of early-spring flowering functional group plants and FB, and the durations of leafing and post-fruiting vegetation of the community. Positive correlations were found between the proportion of mid-summer flowering functional group plants in the community and these variables. There were significant negative correlations between flowering duration of the community and annual mean air temperature and soil moisture. Therefore, our results suggest that different community compositions might respond differently to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We found that warming advanced the start of flowering and the start of fruiting in mid-summerflowering plants. Warming reduced the reproductive output of early-spring flowering plants but did not change their reproductive success. The effects of warming and altered precipitation on the reproductive output and success of mid-summer flowering plants were year-dependent, and the fruiting phenology regulated the response of the mid-summer flowering plant's reproductive success to climate change. These findings highlight the critical role of fruiting phenology in the reproductive success of alpine plants and imply that alpine plants may reduce their fitness by producing fewer flowers and fruits under climate warming, especially for later flowering plants.","2024-10-30","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","2033","291","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND Publisher: ROYAL SOC Type: Article","","","","reproductive phenology; flowering functional groups; precipitation changes; climate warming; alpine meadow; reproductive output","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, alpine plant species and ecosystems experience substantial changes due to prolonged phenological seasons, while the responses, mechanisms and implications remain widely unclear. In this 3-year study, we investigated the effects of advancing snowmelt on the phenology of alpine snowbed species. We related microclimatic drivers to species and ecosystem phenology using in situ monitoring and phenocams. We further used predictive modelling to determine whether early snowmelt sites could be used as sentinels for future conditions. Temperature during the snow-free period primarily influenced flowering phenology, followed by snowmelt timing. Salix herbacea and Gnaphalium supinum showed the most opportunistic phenology, while annual Euphrasia minima struggled to complete its phenology in short growing seasons. Phenological responses varied more between years than sites, indicating potential local long-term adaptations and suggesting these species' potential to track future earlier melting dates. Phenocams captured ecosystem-level phenology (start, peak and end of phenological season) but failed to explain species-level variance. Our findings highlight species-specific responses to advancing snowmelt, with snowbed species responding highly opportunistically to changes in snowmelt timings while following species-specific developmental programs. While species from surrounding grasslands may benefit from extended growing seasons, snowbed species may become outcompeted due to internal-clock-driven, non-opportunistic senescence, despite displaying a high level of phenological plasticity. Our study investigates the phenological responses of five typical snowbed species to advancing snowmelt using in situ monitoring, phenocam imagery and predictive modelling. Over 3 years, we found temperature to be the primary driver of phenological changes in alpine snowbeds, with varying importance of photoperiodism among species. Results suggest a potential diminishing relevance of photoperiodism in warmer conditions.image","2024-07","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","phenophase; snow cover; alpine ecosystem; phenocam; predictive modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Global warming can cause variation in plant functional traits due to phenotypic plasticity or rapid microevolutionary change. Seed mass represents a fundamental axis of trait variation in plants, from an individual to a community scale. Here, we hypothesize that long-term warming can shift the mean seed mass of species. Methods. We tested our hypothesis in plots that had been warmed over 18 years in alpine meadow communities with a history of light grazing (LG) and heavy grazing (HG) on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. In this study, seeds were collected during the growing season of 2015. Results. We found that warming increased the mean seed mass of 4 (n = 19) species in the LG meadow and 6 (n = 20) species in the HG meadow, while decreasing the mean seed mass of 6 species in the LG and HG meadows, respectively. For 7 species, grazing history modified the effect of warming on seed mass. Therefore, we concluded that long-term warming can shift the mean seed mass at the species level. However, the direction of this variation is species-specific. Our study suggests that mean seed mass of alpine plant species appears to decrease in warmer (less stressful) habitats based on life-history theory, but it also suggests there may be an underlying trade-off in which mean seed mass may increase due to greater thermal energy inputs into seed development. Furthermore, the physical and biotic environment modulating this trade-off result in complex patterns of variation in mean seed mass of alpine plant species facing global warming.","2019-07-31","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND Publisher: PEERJ INC Type: Article","","","","Climate change; Functional traits; Grazing; Qinghai-tibet plateau; Trait variation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although a number of studies have addressed responses of plant phenology to warming and altered precipitation individually, their interactions can alter plant phenology differently than either does independently. To explore how the interactions between global change drivers alter alpine ecosystems, we conducted a factorial experiment manipulating warming (ambient and +2 degrees C) and altered precipitation (50% decrease, control, and 50% increase) simultaneously in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Over two years, we monitored plant phenological events, leafout day and first flowering day, for 11 common plant species that account for 74.4% of the total above biomass. Surprisingly, there was no interaction between warming and changes in precipitation on community plant phenology, but warming advanced leaf-out and first flowering day by 7.10 and 9.79 d, respectively. Unlike the community response, plant functional groups had a variety of direct and interactive responses to the experimental climate drivers. While the phenology of legumes was most influenced by temperature, temperature and precipitation interacted to alter the phenology of grasses and forbs. To explore how plant phenological sensitivity on the Tibetan Plateau is compared with other meadow ecosystems, we combined our dataset with a global plant phenology dataset. Interestingly, the phenological sensitivity of leaf-out day and first flowering day on the Tibetan Plateau is 7.3 and 37.8 times greater than global phenological sensitivity, respectively. This result highlights that a meta-analysis of global phenological sensitivity may significantly underestimate change in some regions-even regions as large as the Tibetan Plateau. Together, our results suggest that the Tibetan Plateau may experience rapid change as temperatures warm and that these changes will likely be more rapid than in other regions of the world. Further, our study highlights that if we are to make accurate predictions of how plant phenology may change with warming, we need to understand the specific environmental cues that drive phenological responses across different areas.","2019-01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; global warming; alpine meadow; Tibetan Plateau; altered precipitation; phenological sensitivity; plant functional groups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Warmer winter temperatures are driving reduced snowpack in the western USA with broad potential impacts on ecosystem dynamics of particular concern for protected areas. Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of ecological response to climate change and is associated with snowmelt timing. Human monitoring of climate impacts can be resource prohibitive for land management agencies, whereas remotely sensed phenology observations are freely available at a range of spatiotemporal scales. Little work has been done in regions dominated by evergreen conifer cover, which represents many mountain regions at temperate latitudes. We used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to assess the influence of snowmelt timing and elevation on five phenology metrics (green up, maximum greenness, senescence, dormancy, and growing season length) within Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, USA from 2001 to 2012. Earlier annual mean snowmelt timing was significantly correlated with earlier onset of green up at the landscape scale. Snowmelt timing and elevation have significant explanatory power for phenology, though with high variability. Elevation has a moderate control on early season indicators such as snowmelt timing and green up and less on late-season variables such as senescence and growing season length. PCA results show that early season indicators and late season indicators vary independently. These results have important implications for ecosystem dynamics, management, and conservation, particularly of species such as whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in alpine and subalpine areas.","2018-02","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","273-285","","2","62","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Climate change; Phenology; Snowmelt; National parks; NDVI; Remote sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Snowmelt occurs earlier, but is decoupled from seasonal warming. Climate warming advances the timing of snowmelt and early season phenological events (e. g., the onset of greening and flowering); however, earlier snowmelt without warmer temperatures may have a different effect on phenology. Here, we report the results of a set of snowmelt manipulations in which radiation-absorbing fabric and the addition and removal of dust from the surface of the snowpack advanced or delayed snowmelt in the alpine tundra. These changes in the timing of snowmelt were superimposed on a system where the timing of snowmelt varies with topography and has been affected by increased dust loading. At the community level, phenology exhibited a threshold response to the timing of snowmelt. Greening and flowering were delayed before seasonal warming, after which there was a linear relationship between the date of snowmelt and the timing of phenological events. Consequently, the effects of earlier snowmelt on phenology differed in relation to topography, which resulted in increasing synchronicity in phenology across the alpine landscape with increasingly earlier snowmelt. The consequences of earlier snowmelt from increased dust deposition differ from climate warming and include delayed phenology, leading to synchronized growth and flowering across the landscape and the opportunity for altered species interactions, landscape-scale gene flow via pollination, and nutrient cycling.","2009-07-14","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","11629-11634","","28","106","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA Publisher: NATL ACAD SCIENCES Type: Article","","","","phenology; climate warming; plant life history; synchronization; threshold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Altered phenology can introduce organisms to novel abiotic conditions during growth and modify species interactions, both of which could drive changes in reproduction. We explored how climate change can alter plant reproduction using an experiment in which we manipulated the individual and combined effects of snowmelt timing and frost exposure, and measured subsequent effects on flowering phenology, peak flower density, frost damage, pollinator visitation and reproduction of four subalpine wildflowers. Additionally, we conducted a pollen-supplementation experiment to test whether the plants in our snowmelt and frost treatments were pollen limited for reproduction. The four plants included species flowering in early spring to mid-summer. The phenology of all four species was significantly advanced, and the bloom duration was longer in the plots from which we removed snow, but with species-specific responses to snow removal and frost exposure in terms of frost damage, flower production, pollinator visitation and reproduction. The two early blooming species showed significant signs of frost damage in both early snowmelt and frost treatments, which negatively impacted reproduction for one of the species. Further, we recorded fewer pollinators during flowering for the earliest-blooming species in the snow removal plots. We also found lower fruit and seed set for the early blooming species in the snow removal treatment, which could be attributed to the plants growing under unfavourable abiotic conditions. However, the later-blooming species escaped frost damage even in the plots where snow was removed, and experienced increased pollinator visitation and reproduction. Synthesis. This study provides insight into how plant communities could become altered due to changes in abiotic conditions, and some of the mechanisms involved. While early blooming species may be at a disadvantage under climate change, species that bloom later in the season may benefit from early snowmelt, suggesting that climate change has the potential to reshape flowering communities.","2019-07","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1970-1981","","4","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; phenology; plant reproduction; frost; plant-pollinator interactions; pollination services; snowmelt timing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the phenology of some plant species does not advance beyond a threshold snowmelt date, the prevalence of such threshold phenological responses within plant communities is largely unknown. We therefore examined the shape of flowering phenology responses (linear versus nonlinear) to climate using two long-term datasets from plant communities in snow-dominated environments: Gothic, CO, USA (19742011) and Zackenberg, Greenland (1996-2011). For a total of 64 species, we determined whether a linear or nonlinear regression model best explained interannual variation in flowering phenology in response to increasing temperatures and advancing snowmelt dates. The most common nonlinear trend was for species to flower earlier as snowmelt advanced, with either no change or a slower rate of change when snowmelt was early (average 20% of cases). By contrast, some species advanced their flowering at a faster rate over the warmest temperatures relative to cooler temperatures (average 5% of cases). Thus, some species seem to be approaching their limits of phenological change in response to snowmelt but not temperature. Such phenological thresholds could either be a result of minimum springtime photoperiod cues for flowering or a slower rate of adaptive change in flowering time relative to changing climatic conditions.","2013-08-19","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","1624","368","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND Publisher: ROYAL SOC Type: Article","","","","climate change; plant phenology; alpine; Arctic; long-term monitoring; timing of flowering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In some species, however, response to warming is more complex than a simple advance in the timing of all life history events preceding reproduction. Disparities in the extent to which different components of the reproductive phenology of organisms vary with climatic warming indicate that not all life history events are equally responsive to environmental variation. Here, we propose that our understanding of phenological response to climate change can be improved by considering entire sequences of events comprising the aggregate life histories of organisms preceding reproduction. We present results of a two-year warming experiment conducted on 33 individuals of three plant species inhabiting a low-arctic site. Analysis of phenological sequences of three key events for each species revealed how the aggregate life histories preceding reproduction responded to warming, and which individual events exerted the greatest influence on aggregate life history variation. For alpine chickweed (Cerastium alpinum), warming elicited a shortening of the duration of the emergence stage by 2.5 days on average, but the aggregate life history did not differ between warmed and ambient plots. For gray willow (Salix glauca), however, all phenological events monitored occurred earlier on warmed than on ambient plots, and warming reduced the aggregate life history of this species by 22 days on average. Similarly, in dwarf birch (Betula nana), warming advanced flower bud set, blooming, and fruit set and reduced the aggregate life history by 27 days on average. Our approach provides important insight into life history responses of many organisms to climate change and other forms of environmental variation. Such insight may be compromised by considering changes in individual phenological events in isolation.","2008-02","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","363-370","","2","89","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; phenology; global warming; arctic; Betula nana; Cerastium alpinum; Salix glauca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flowering season varied from late May to early August among species. There was a positive correlation between flowering time and fruit-set under natural conditions. Pollinator exclusion by net-bagging and hand-pollination revealed that very low fruit-set in early-flowering species was caused by severe pollen limitation, while late-flowering species tended to have high fruit-set with slight pollen limitation. Such seasonal patterns reflect the changes in seasonal activity of pollinating insects, which are highly influenced by ambient temperature. A similar research program was conducted in a subarctic heathland in northern Sweden with almost similar species composition. In Sweden, however, there was no positive correlation between flowering time and fruit-set. The difference between the alpine fellfields and the subarctic heathland may be caused by the specific seasonal pattern of temperature change in either region.

Despite this, there has been no overall shift in flowering phenology over this period. However, climate change has also resulted in increased interannual variation in temperature; if relationships between phenology and temperature are not linear, an increase in temperature variance may interact with an increase in the mean to alter how community phenology changes over time. In our system, the relationship between phenology and temperature was log-linear, resulting in a steeper slope at the cold end of the temperature spectrum than at the warm end. Because below-average temperatures had a greater impact on phenology than above-average temperatures, the long-term advance in phenology was reduced. In addition, flowering phenology in a given year was delayed if summer temperatures were high the previous year or 2 years earlier (lag effects), further reducing the expected advance over time. Phenology of early-flowering plants was negatively affected only by temperatures in the previous year, and that of late-flowering plants primarily by temperatures 2 years earlier. Subarctic plants develop leaf primordia one or more years prior to flowering (preformation); these results suggest that temperature affects the development of flower primordia during this preformation period. Together, increased variance in temperature and lag effects interacted with a changing mean to reduce the expected phenological advance by 94%, a magnitude large enough to account for our inability to detect a significant advance over time. We conclude that changes in temperature variability and lag effects can alter trends in plant responses to a warming climate and that predictions for changes in plant phenology under future warming scenarios should incorporate such effects.","2017-02","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","801-814","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; tundra; Cape Churchill Peninsula; flower preformation; Hudson Bay lowlands; nonlinear responses; plant flowering phenology; saltmarsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The order of returning to green determines the growth strategies of different plants, the earliest plants to green (p<0.05) (e.g., Stipa purpurea and Artemisia scoparia) would choose the strategy of vegetative growth (p<0.05); the earlier plants (p<0.05) (e.g., Kobresia humilis) would be regulated by both vegetative growth and reproductive growth (p<0.05); while the latest plant to green (p<0.05) such as Astragalus laxmannii, would choose intrinsic growth rate rather than growing season (P<0.05).

The main objective of this study is to find out the impact of early snowmelt on herb communities of treeline ecotone (3200-3300 m elevations) located in Tungnath, Uttarakhand Himalaya. The focus is on species composition, species diversity and phenology. For this, we have followed two research approaches: first, comparing the herb communities of sites and microsites differing in the timing of snowmelt and the amount of snow cover, and second, comparing the phenology of common herb species with the past studies undertaken at the same and similar sites. We sampled several microsites which differed in the timing of snowmelt and were accordingly divisible into early snowmelt and late snowmelt microsites, the difference between them being of 3-5 days. Of the 86 species recorded across the sites, 84% were hemicryptophytic perennial forbs, and about 70% of them were native. Both herb species richness and species diversity were significantly higher in early snowmelt microsites than in late snowmelt microsites, both in high snow cover and low snow cover habitats. The total plant density ranged between 82-626 individuals m(-2) in early snowmelt microsites and 69-288 individuals m(-2) in late snowmelt microsites. It seems that the early snowmelt in a warming climate would promote species diversity and plant density. Comparison to the past studies indicates that because of climatic warming species have advanced and lengthened their vegetative and flowering phenophases. We could not assess whether migration of species from lower elevations contributed to high species richness of early snowmelt microsites. However, it cannot be ruled out, given that continent-wide species enrichments near mountain summits have been recorded elsewhere.","2018-09","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","365-382","","2, SI","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article","","","","Climate change; phenophase; life form; early snowmelt; species diversity; treeline ecotone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The warming of terrestrial high-latitude ecosystems, while increasing, will likely be asymmetric across seasons-where winter non-growing seasons will warm more than summer-growing seasons. Asymmetric winter warming in temperature-sensitive ecosystems may delay spring phenological events by reducing the opportunity that a plants' chilling requirement is met. Similarly, symmetric warming can advance spring phenology. 2. To explore the impact of asymmetric warming on plant phenology, we applied a year-round warming and a winter warming treatment to our experimental plots. Over a 2-year period, we monitored leaf-out and flowering phenology for 11 plant species. 3. There was variation among species, however, both winter and year-round warming, advanced the leaf-out day and the first flowering day relative to the control treatment. Winter warming advanced leaf-out and flowering phenology by 11.1 (+/- 2.4) and 12.6 (+/- 2.9) days respectively. However, year-round warming had less of an impact advancing leaf-out and flowering phenology by 5.1 (+/- 2.1) and 10.0 (+/- 3.0) days respectively. 4. Our study provides direct evidence that asymmetric winter warming has a larger impact on plant phenology than symmetric year-round warming. Increasing soil temperature in the winter from below to above freezing temperatures advanced the spring phenology of alpine plants. Winter warming increased soil temperature more than year-round warming, which explains why phenology advanced under winter warming more than under year-round warming.

However, the process of seasonal vegetative development under warming and early snowmelt conditions remains unclear, especially given that disturbance can amplify or dampen the effect of warming. This study addressed these issues using a 3-year experiment in a productive grassland in a cool temperate region. Three experimental conditions were established in the grassland: warming and early snowmelt using open-top chambers (OTCs), early snow removal and ambient temperature (SRs), and natural snowmelt and ambient temperature (CONTs). Half of the area of all plots was plowed to disturb soil conditions. Average temperature and snowmelt were 1.37 A degrees C higher and 16-26 days earlier in OTCs relative to CONTs, respectively. Vegetation censuses during the 1-4 week intervals showed earlier increases in species richness and vegetation cover after snowmelt in OTCs than CONTs and SRs. Differences in species richness and plant cover among treatments were substantially diminished in plowed areas. Aboveground biomass showed little difference among treatments at the end of the growing season, while richness remained higher in OTCs. These results indicate that early snow removal did not alter grassland vegetation. The effect of OTCs can thus be due to either warming or a combination of early snowmelt and warming. Although climate change is predicted to have strong impacts on arctic and alpine ecosystems, this study suggests that the warming may also have important impacts in temperate regions.","2014-12","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1399-1408","","12","215","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Diversity; Productivity; Cool temperate; Miscanthus sinensis; Open-top chamber; Snow removal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phenological shifts have also been reported in alpine environments, where short growing seasons and low temperatures make reproduction particularly challenging, requiring fine-tuning to environmental cues. However, it remains unclear if species from such habitats, with their specific adaptations, harbour the same potential for phenological plasticity as species from less demanding habitats. Methods Fourteen congeneric species pairs originating from mid and high elevation were reciprocally transplanted to common gardens at 1050 and 2000 m a.s.l. that mimic prospective climates and natural field conditions. A drought treatment was implemented to assess the combined effects of temperature and precipitation changes on the onset and duration of reproductive phenophases. A phenotypic plasticity index was calculated to evaluate if mid- and high-elevation species harbour the same potential for plasticity in reproductive phenology. Key Results Transplantations resulted in considerable shifts in reproductive phenology, with highly advanced initiation and shortened phenophases at the lower (and warmer) site for both mid- and high-elevation species. Drought stress amplified these responses and induced even further advances and shortening of phenophases, a response consistent with an `escape strategy'. The observed phenological shifts were generally smaller in number of days for high-elevation species and resulted in a smaller phenotypic plasticity index, relative to their mid-elevation congeners. Conclusions While mid- and high-elevation species seem to adequately shift their reproductive phenology to track ongoing climate changes, high-elevation species were less capable of doing so and appeared more genetically constrained to their specific adaptations to an extreme environment (i.e. a short, cold growing season).","2015-11","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","953-962","","6, SI","116","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","drought; Climate change; flowering phenology; global warming; phenotypic plasticity; Swiss Alps; common garden; mid-elevation and high-elevation species","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic literature review evaluates the effects of climate change on plant and pollinator traits on a global scale to determine how species responses vary among Earth's ecosystems, climate variables, taxonomic groups, and organismal traits. We compiled studies conducted under natural or experimental conditions (excluding agricultural species) and analyzed species response patterns for each trait (advance vs. delay or no change for phenology, decrease vs. increase or no change for other traits). Climate change has advanced plant and animal phenologies across most Earth's biomes, but evidence for temporal plant-pollinator mismatches remains limited. Flower production and plant reproductive success showed diverse responses to warming and low water availability in Alpine and Temperate ecosystems, and a trend for increased or neutral responses in Arctic and Tropical biomes. Nectar rewards mainly experienced negative effects under warming and drought across Alpine and Temperate biomes, but scent emissions increased or changed in composition. Life form (woody vs. nonwoody species) did not significantly influence trait response patterns to climate change. Pollinator fecundity, size, life-history, developmental, and physiological traits mostly declined with warming across biomes; however, animal abundance and resource acquisition traits showed diverse responses. This review identified critical knowledge gaps that limit our understanding of the impacts of climate change, particularly in tropical/subtropical biomes and southern latitudes. It also highlights the urgent need to sample across a greater range of plant families and pollinator taxa (e.g., beetles, wasps, vertebrates). The diversity of climate change effects should be assessed in the context of other anthropogenic drivers of global change that threaten critically important pollination interactions.","2025-02","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Review","","","","climate change; phenology; snowmelt; warming; floral traits; nectar; plant reproductive success; pollinator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known on the temperature sensitivity of different phenophases and on the characteristics allowing phenological variation among and within species. By integrating interannual micro-climatic variability with experimental warming, we explored how the phenology of three alpine species is influenced by temperature and what mechanisms underlie intra- and inter-specific phenological differences. The present study demonstrated that alpine plants have different temperature responses during their reproductive cycle, do not have constant thermal thresholds and heat-use efficiencies to achieve the seed dispersal stage and can change their temperature sensitivity to flower along snowmelt gradients. In addition, the length of the reproductive cycle, which proved to be species-specific under experimental warming, does not seem to be the only life-history trait under selective pressure due to the short-length of the snow-free period. In a warming climate scenario, the phenology of sexual reproduction will be considerably altered, and alpine plants may be subjected to changes in population dynamics driven by altered perception of environmental cues appropriate for coordinating the timing of key life-history events.","2018-07","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1014-1023","","7","127","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","temperature sensitivity; phenophaces; reproductive cycle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phenological activities are among the most sensitive plant responses to climate change and have important effects at all levels within the ecosystem. We tested the effects of two experimental treatments, extended growing season via snow removal and extended growing season combined with soil warming, on plant phenology in tussock tundra in Alaska from 1995 through 2003. We specifically monitored the responses of eight species, representing four growth forms: (i) graminoids (Carex bigellowii and Eriophorum vaginatum); (ii) evergreen shrubs (Ledum palustre, Cassiope tetragona, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea); (iii) deciduous shrubs (Betula nana and Salix pulchra); and (iv) forbs (Polygonum bistorta). Our study answered three questions: (i) Do experimental treatments affect the timing of leaf bud break, flowering, and leaf senescence? (ii) Are responses to treatments species-specific and growth form-specific? and (iii) Which environmental factors best predict timing of phenophases? Treatment significantly affected the timing of all three phenophases, although the two experimental treatments did not differ from each other. While phenological events began earlier in the experimental plots relative to the controls, duration of phenophases did not increase. The evergreen shrub, Cassiope tetragona, did not respond to either experimental treatment. While the other species did respond to experimental treatments, the total active period for these species did not increase relative to the control. Air temperature was consistently the best predictor of phenology. Our results imply that some evergreen shrubs (i.e., C.tetragona) will not capitalize on earlier favorable growing conditions, putting them at a competitive disadvantage relative to phenotypically plastic deciduous shrubs. Our findings also suggest that an early onset of the growing season as a result of decreased snow cover will not necessarily result in greater tundra productivity.","2015-12","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","4520-4532","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; phenology; tundra; arctic; Alaska; growth form; season length; snow removal; soil warming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We experimentally advanced snowmelt in two contrasting plant community types (heath and meadow) in northern Sweden and measured above- and below-ground phenology (leaf-out, flowering and fine root growth). We expected earlier snowmelt to advance both above- and below-ground phenology, and shrub-dominated heath to be more responsive than meadow. 3. Snow melted on average 9 days earlier in the manipulated plots than in controls, and soil temperatures were on average 0.9 degrees C higher during the snowmelt period of 3 weeks. This resulted in small advances in above-ground phenology, but contrary to our expectations, root phenology was unresponsive, with root growth generally starting before leaf-out. These responses to the snowmelt treatment were similar in both plant community types, despite strong differences in dominating plant functional types and root properties, such as root length and turnover. 4. The lack of a response in root phenology, despite warmer soil temperatures and above-ground phenological advances, adds evidence that above-ground plant responses might not be directly translated to below-ground plant responses, and that our understanding of factors driving below-ground phenology is still limited, although of major importance for water, nutrient and carbon cycling.","2017-07","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1493-1502","","7","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; phenology; snowmelt; alpine; arctic; fine roots; root growth; root production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed phenological patterns in relation to temperature and precipitation for 287 species and growing degree days (GDD) for 235 species. Average low temperature, maximum GDD, and average precipitation increased over the study period. As temperature and GDD increased, phenology advanced, but as precipitation increased, phenology was delayed. Even with this variability of environmental responses, a significant trend of earlier flowering appeared when all species were analyzed together. Of the species that showed significantly earlier flowering dates, they advanced on average more than 39 days over the 61 years of the study. When assessing only specimens of species monitored in a national program (USA National Phenology Network), we found that these species showed similar trends to the entire dataset.

Under climate change, snowmelt advances and the risk of summer droughts increases. Yet, photoperiodism may prevent alpine plants from benefiting from an earlier start of the growing season. To identify the drivers of flowering phenology in the seven main species of an alpine grassland, we experimentally shifted the snowmelt date through snow manipulations, and excluded precipitation during summer. With “time-to-event” models, we analysed the beginning of main flowering with respect to temperature sums, time after snowmelt, and calendar day (photoperiod). We identified two phenology types: four species tracking snowmelt dates directly or with a certain lag set by temperature sums, including the dominant sedge Carex curvula, Anthoxanthum alpinum Helictotrichon versicolor, and Trifolium alpinum, and three species tracking photoperiod: Geum montanum, Leontodon helveticus and Potentilla aurea. Photoperiodism did not act as daylength threshold but rather modulated the thermal sums at flowering. Hence, photoperiod delayed flowering after earlier snowmelt. The grass A. alpinum was the only one of seven species that clearly responded to drought by earlier and longer flowering. The remarkably high importance of snowmelt dates for both phenology types suggests an earlier onset of flowering in a warmer climate, particularly for non-photoperiod-sensitive species, with an increasing risk for freezing damages and potential disruptions of biotic interactions in the most frequent type of alpine grassland across the Alps. Consequentially, the distinct microclimate and species-specific responses to photoperiod challenge temperature-only based projections of climate warming effects on alpine plant species.","2021-04","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","73-88","","1","131","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND Publisher: SPRINGER BASEL AG Type: Article","","","","Climate change; Photoperiod; Alps; Growing season; High elevation; Snow cover; Survival analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Warming affects reproductive and vegetative traits, as well as phenology, but seldom do studies assess these traits in concert and across the whole of a plant's life cycle, particularly in wild species. Thus, it is difficult to extrapolate from such effects to predictions about the persistence of species or their conservation and management. We assessed trait variation in response to warming in Oreomyrrhis eriopoda, an Australian native montane herb, in which populations vary in germination strategy (degree of dormancy) and growth characteristics as a function of ecological factors. Warming accelerated growth in the early stages of development, particularly for populations with non-dormant seed. The differences in growth disappeared at the transition to reproduction, when an accelerating effect on phenology emerged, to varying degrees depending on germination strategy. Overall, warming reduced flower and seed production and increased mortality, indicating a reduction in reproductive opportunities, particularly for populations with dormant seed. Developmental condition affected germination strategy of the next generation seed, leading to increased degree of dormancy and slowed germination rate. But there were no whole-scale shifts in strategy or total germination percent. Following through the life cycle reveals that warming will have some potentially positive effects (early growth rates) and some negative effects (reduced reproductive output). Ultimately, warming impacts will depend on how those effects play out in the field: early establishment and an accelerated trajectory to seed maturitymay offset the tradeoff with overall seed production. Small differences among germination strategies likewise may cascade to larger effects, with important implications for persistence of species in the alpine landscape. Thus, to understand and manage the response of wild species to warming takes a whole-of-life perspective and attention to ecologically significant patterns of within-species variation.","2021-04-28","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","Germination temperature; intraspecific trait variation; maternal effects; phenotypic plasticity; seed development temperature; transgenerational effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt extend the growing season length and increase drought stress for alpine plants, resulting in changes to their distribution. Anemone narcissiflora ssp. sachalinensis is a perennial herb that grows in the alpine snow-meadows of northern Japan. In the last few decades, its distribution has shifted toward later snowmelt habitat in the Taisetsu Mountains of Hokkaido. We recorded demographic data for this species at early, middle and late snowmelt habitats over four years (2009-2012), and constructed transition matrix models to evaluate how demographic parameters and population growth rate vary between local habitats along a snowmelt gradient. The proportion of reproductive plants was low and seed production was limited in the early snowmelt habitat, with drier soil conditions, in comparison to the middle and late snowmelt habitats, with moist soil conditions. Evidence of the transition from small plants to those in the reproductive stage was limited in the early snowmelt habitat, suggesting that growth was inhibited; the local population in this habitat was estimated to be sustained by seed migration from later snowmelt habitats. These results indicate that advancing snowmelt under climate change may decrease the reproductive activity and population growth rate of snow-meadow plants if seed migration from later snowmelt populations is limited, resulting in the extinction of local populations.","2021-07","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","260-271","","3","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","demography; global warming; snowmelt time; alpine plant; population matrix model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, how species-level phenological responses scale up to affect community-level reproductive phenology patterns (synchrony and reproductive duration) are still unclear.2. An experiment on the effects of nitrogen (N) addition and precipitation changes on reproductive phenological traits of 52 species was conducted in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau to determine the influence of the phenological response in different functional groups on community-level reproductive phenology.3. N addition significantly delayed the onset date of reproductive phenology of sedges (early-flowering species) and advanced the end date of reproduction of forbs (late-flowering species). Meanwhile, N addition reduced the number of individuals involved in reproduction of sedges and forbs, but it increased that of grasses (late-flowering species). Furthermore, N addition increased reproductive synchrony, delayed the onset and shortened the duration of reproductive phenology at the community level. However, precipitation changes and their interaction with N addition had no significant effect on reproductive phenology of the alpine plant community.4. Synthesis. These results suggested that differences in the direction and magnitude of response of different species to N enrichment lead to compression of reproductive duration at the community level, increasing the degree of overlap between reproductive events, which could change future species diversity, trophic interactions and productivity accumulation in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau.

To predict how alpine plants respond to shifts in snowmelt timing, we need to understand trait plasticity, its effects on growth and reproduction, and the degree to which plants experience a home-site advantage. We tested how the common, long-lived dwarf shrub Salix herbacea responded to changing spring snowmelt time by reciprocally transplanting turfs of S. herbacea between early-exposure ridge and late-exposure snowbed microhabitats. After the transplant, we monitored phenological, morphological and fitness traits, as well as leaf damage, during two growing seasons. Salix herbacea leafed out earlier, but had a longer development time and produced smaller leaves on ridges relative to snowbeds. Longer phenological development times and smaller leaves were associated with reduced sexual reproduction on ridges. On snowbeds, larger leaves and intermediate development times were associated with increased clonal reproduction. Clonal and sexual reproduction showed no response to altered snowmelt time. We found no home-site advantage in terms of sexual and clonal reproduction. Leaf damage probability depended on snowmelt and thus exposure period, but had no short-term effect on fitness traits. We conclude that the studied populations of S. herbacea can respond to shifts in snowmelt by plastic changes in phenology and leaf size, while maintaining levels of clonal and sexual reproduction. The lack of a home-site advantage suggests that S. herbacea may not be adapted to different microhabitats. The studied populations are thus unlikely to react to climate change by rapid adaptation, but their responses will also not be constrained by small-scale local adaptation. In the short term, snowbed plants may persist due to high stem densities. However, in the long term, reduction in leaf size and flowering, a longer phenological development time and increased exposure to damage may decrease overall performance of S. herbacea under earlier snowmelt.","2015-04-20","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA Publisher: PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Temperature sensitivity of phenology might be greater in colder, higher latitude sites than in warmer regions, in part because small changes in temperature constitute greater relative changes in thermal balance at colder sites. To test this hypothesis, we examined up to 20 years of phenology data for 47 tundra plant species at 18 high-latitude sites along a climatic gradient. Across all species, the timing of leaf emergence and flowering was more sensitive to a given increase in summer temperature at colder than warmer high-latitude locations. A similar pattern was seen over time for the flowering phenology of a widespread species, Cassiope tetragona. These are among the first results highlighting differential phenological responses of plants across a climatic gradient and suggest the possibility of convergence in flowering times and therefore an increase in gene flow across latitudes as the climate warms.","2017-07","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","2660-2671","","7","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; flowering; Arctic; International Tundra Experiment; latitude; tundra; Cassiope tetragona; climatic gradient","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By using open-top chambers, we experimentally manipulated both summer temperatures and winter and spring snow accumulations and temperatures independently in a blanket bog in subarctic Sweden, yielding six climate scenarios. We studied the effects of these scenarios on flowering phenology and flower production of Andromeda polifolia (woody evergreen) and Rubus chamaemorus (perennial herb) during 2 years. The second year of our study (2002) was characterized by unusually high spring and early summer temperatures. Our winter manipulations led to consistent increases in winter snow cover. As a result, average and minimum air and soil temperatures in the high snow cover treatments were higher than in the winter ambient treatments, whereas temperature fluctuations were smaller. Spring warming resulted in higher average, minimum, and maximum soil temperatures. Summer warming led to higher air and soil temperatures in mid-summer (June-July), but not in late summer (August-September). The unusually high temperatures in 2002 advanced the median flowering date by 2 weeks for both species in all treatments. Superimposed on this effect, we found that for both Andromeda and Rubus, all our climate treatments (except summer warming for Rubus) advanced flowering by 1-4 days. The total flower production of both species showed a more or less similar response: flower production in the warm year 2002 exceeded that in 2001 by far. However, in both species flower production was only stimulated by the spring-warming treatments. Our results show that the reproductive ecology of both species is very responsive to climate change but this response is very dependent on specific climate events, especially those that occur in winter and spring. This suggests that high-latitude climate change experiments should focus more on winter and spring events than has been the case so far.","2004-09","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","1599-1609","","9","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA Publisher: WILEY-BLACKWELL Type: Article","","","","phenology; global warming; Andromeda polifolia; Rubus chamaemorus; sexual reproduction; winter temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alpine snowbeds, i.e. alpine tundra from late snowmelt sites, might be particularly susceptible to such climatic changes. Snowbed communities were grown in large monoliths for two consecutive years, under different manipulated snow cover treatments, to test for effects of early (E) and late (L) snowmelt on dominant species growth, plant functional traits, leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground productivity. Spring snow cover was reduced to assess the sensitivity of snowbed alpine species to severe early frost events, and dominant species freezing temperatures were measured. Aboveground biomass, productivity, LAI and dominant species growth did not increase significantly in E compared to L treatments, indicating inability to respond to an extended growing season. Edapho-climatic conditions could not account for these results, suggesting that developmental constraints are important in controlling snowbed plant growth. Impaired productivity was only detected when harsher and more frequent frost events were experimentally induced by early snowmelt. These conditions exposed plants to spring frosts, reaching temperatures consistent with the estimated freezing points of the dominant species (similar to-10 degrees C). We conclude that weak plasticity in phenological response and potential detrimental effects of early frosts explain why alpine tundra from snowbeds is not expected to benefit from increased growing season length.","2010-09","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","755-764","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","Alopecurus gerardi; alpine tundra; Carex foetida; early frost; growing season length; Poa alpina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These effects can be highly variable in time and space. In this study we investigated how different abiotic and biotic factors influence reproductive investment and success in populations of Ranunculus acris across an alpine landscape over a two-year period. In an alpine area at Finse, southern Norway, we measured reproductive investment (total seed mass) and reproductive success (seed-set rate) in 38 sites differing in temperature (related to elevation) and length of the growing season (related to time of snowmelt). To assess biotic interactions, we measured floral density and pollinator visits and conducted a supplemental pollen experiment. Reproductive investment and success increased with temperature, but only when floral density and/or number of pollinator visits was high, and only in the warmer year (2016). Reproduction in R. acris was pollen-limited in both years, especially at warmer temperature and in sites with early snowmelt. Pollinator visits increased with temperature and with higher floral density, suggesting a shift in relative importance of the biotic factors (from plants to pollinators) in limiting reproduction with increasing temperature. Our study shows that reproductive investment and success in R. acris is affected by climate through the interactive effects of abiotic and biotic processes. These effects vary between years and across the landscape, suggesting a potential for larger-scale buffering of climate change effects in heterogeneous landscapes.","2024-10","2025-03-06 11:17:01","2025-03-06 11:17:01","","123-139","","2, SI","134","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND Publisher: SPRINGER BASEL AG Type: Article","","","","Phenology; Seed set; Mountains; Pollen limitation; Reproductive output; Timing of snowmelt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such shifts are likely accentuated in the rapidly warming Arctic. Targeting a plant community in Northeast Greenland, we asked (a) whether the relative phenology of plants is shifting with spatial variation in temperature, (b) whether local plants compete for pollination, and (c) whether shifts in climatic conditions are likely to affect this competition. We first searched for climatic imprints on relative species phenology along an elevational gradient. We then tested for signs of competition with increasing flower densities: reduced pollinator visits, reduced representation of plant species in pollen loads, and reduced seed production. Finally, we evaluated how climate change may affect this competition. Compared to a dominant species,Dryas integrifolia x octopetala, the relative timing of other species shifted along the environmental gradient, withSilene acaulisandPapaver radicatumflowering earlier toward higher elevation. This shift resulted in larger niche overlap, allowing for an increased potential for competition for pollination. Meanwhile,Dryasemerged as a superior competitor by attracting 97.2% of flower visits. HigherDryasdensity resulted in reduced insect visits and less pollen ofS. acaulisbeing carried by pollinators, causing reduced seed set byS. acaulis. Our results show that current variation in climate shifts the timing and flowering overlap between dominant and less-competitive plant species. With climate warming, such shifts in phenology within trophic levels may ultimately affect interactions between them, changing the strength of competition among plants.","2020-11","2025-03-06 11:17:02","2025-03-06 11:17:02","","6313-6325","","11","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","flowering phenology; pollination; arctic ecology; climate change effects; competition for pollination; indirect competition; phenology shift","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We might, therefore, expect to see earlier flowering of later-season flowering Arctic plants. Parks Canada has been monitoring purple saxifrage (Saxifraga oppositifolia) and mountain avens (Dryas iniegrifolia) flowering and fruiting times for 20 years at Tanquary Fiord, Quttinirpaaq National Park, Ellesmere Island. Saxifraga oppositifolia flowers in early spring, while D. integrifolia flowers in midsummer. Over the 20-year period, Tanquary Fiord's annual and late-summer temperatures have risen significantly. During the same timeframe, D. integrifolia showed a trend towards earlier flowering and fruiting, but S. oppositifolia showed no changes in flowering or fruiting time. Flowering time was related to monthly temperatures just prior to flowering. The number of flowers produced was related to the previous autumn's monthly temperatures. We found no relationship between flowering time and snowmelt date.

Snowmelt timing and temperature are known to affect the timing of bud burst, but their effects on autumn senescence are less clear. To address this, researchers have examined senescence under natural and experimental environmental gradients. However, these approaches address different aspects of plant responses and the extent to which they can be compared is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the effect of snowmelt timing on the timing of autumn senescence in High Arctic plants is the same between a natural and an experimental gradient in three out of four studied species. While the two approaches mostly produce comparable results, they give in combination greater insight into the phenological responses to predicted climate changes. We also showed that a short warming treatment in autumn delayed senescence by 3.5 days in Dryas octopetala L., which is a 10% extension of the growing season end for this species. Warming treatments have commonly been applied to the whole growing season, but here we show that even isolated autumn warming can be sufficient to affect plant senescence.","2022-09","2025-03-06 11:17:02","2025-03-06 11:17:02","","744-766","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 123 Slater Street, Suite 610, OTTAWA, ON K1P 5H2, CANADA Publisher: CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING Type: Article","","","","phenology; warming; experimental gradient; natural gradient; senescence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also explored a related hypothesis, that flower abundance of late-flowering species is more responsive to changes in climate than that of early-flowering species. The Delphinium species did not support these hypotheses, but the Mertensia species did. The difference between the peak flowering times of the early and late Mertensia species is expanding, leading to a period of diminished resources for pollinators that specialize on this genus. Mertensia ciliata Populations are already severely declining in our study area, possibly as a result of earlier snowmelt. Together, these results show that the reported differences between early- and late-flowering species may be widespread, but they are not ubiquitous.","2009-10","2025-03-06 11:17:02","2025-03-06 11:17:02","","1821-1829","","10","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","climate change; flowering phenology; snowmelt; global warming; frost; Ranunculaceae; Boraginaceae; Delphinium; flower abundance; Mertensia; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
