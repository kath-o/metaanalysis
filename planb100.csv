482EVXTS,journalArticle,2005,"Singh, KP; Kushwaha, CP",Emerging paradigms of tree phenology in dry tropics,CURRENT SCIENCE,,0011-3891,,,"The tropical dry forests constitute a mosaic composed of several phenological functional types adapted to seasonal drought in different ways. Various functional types differ with respect to phenological timing and triggering factors, water relations, extent of deciduousness (similar to leaflessness), etc. Duration of deciduousness in tropical trees (reflecting integrated effect of seasonal drought, tree characteristics and soil moisture conditions) is related to leafing patterns and resource use rates. Vegetative and flowering phenology of trees in dry tropics is primarily affected by the periodicity of rainfall and soil water availability. Occurrence of leaf-flushing as well as flowering during summer in majority of Indian tropical trees, when drought is severe, seems to be a unique adaptation to survive under strongly seasonal climate having a short growth promoting wet period and a long growth constraining dry period. The key phenological themes that need research focus in the dry tropics are: duration of deciduousness, timing of vegetative bud break, leaf strategy, water relations, seasonal flowering types and asynchrony. Analysis of functional types based on the duration of deciduousness and timing of bud break may enable better assessment of future climate change impact. There is a need for long-term quantitative documentation of tree phenological patterns in India through a phenological station network in diverse climatie/vegetational zones.",25/09/2005,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,964-975,,6,89,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA Publisher: INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES Type: Review",,,,climate change; deciduousness; flowering types; functional types; quantitative phenology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of particular concern are tropical biomes, which represent the most biodiverse and imperilled regions of the world. However, compared to temperate floras, we know little about phenological responses of tropical plants because long-term observational datasets from the tropics are sparse. Herbarium specimens have greatly increased our phenological knowledge in temperate regions, but similar data have been underutilized in the tropics and their suitability for this purpose has not been broadly validated. Here, we compare phenological estimates derived from field observational data (i.e. plot surveys) and herbarium specimens at various spatial and taxonomic scales to determine whether specimens can provide accurate estimations of reproductive timing and its spatial variation. Here, we demonstrate that phenological estimates from field observations and herbarium specimens coincide well. Fewer than 5% of the species exhibited significant differences between flowering periods inferred from field observations versus specimens regardless of spatial aggregation. In contrast to studies based on field records, herbarium specimens sampled much larger geographic and climatic ranges, as has been documented previously for temperate plants, and effectively captured phenological responses across varied environments. Synthesis. Herbarium specimens are verified to be a vital resource for closing the gap in our phenological knowledge of tropical systems. Tropical plant reproductive phenology inferred from herbarium records is widely congruent with field observations, suggesting that they can and should be used to investigate phenological variation and their associated environmental cues more broadly across tropical biomes.",2023-02,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,327-337,,2,111,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,phenology; Brazil; climate; herbaria; citizen science; field survey; natural history collections; neotropics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in recent years, accumulating evidence has suggested that tropical forests vary widely both in climate and phenology, that climate and phenology are inextricably linked, and that tropical forests increasingly display the effects of climate change. It is critically important to understand these climate-phenology interactions to be able to predict the cascading impacts on resource availability that will affect wildlife. There are many important and unanswered questions regarding how the mechanistic drivers and proximate cues of tropical forest reproductive phenology will vary in response to environmental change. Addressing these questions remains a huge challenge due to a paucity of long-term comparable data that hampers our ability to connect observed phenology patterns with fundamental theory. In this review, we highlight ten focal papers that have advanced our ability to identify phenological patterns, improved our understanding of the drivers of flowering and fruiting, and have innovatively linked fruiting patterns with impacts on wildlife diet, reproduction, and survival. We end with a call for increased collaboration among forest and wildlife ecologists, theoretical ecologists, meteorologists, and decision-makers to advance and apply phenological research in the tropics and reduce the negative impact of climate change on vital ecological functions, and services, of tropical forest ecosystems.",2024-03,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,175-187,,3,225,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Climate change; Phenology; Cue; Driver; Forest function; Tropical forests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LJC8MI57,journalArticle,2017,"Chen, Xiaoqiu; Wang, Lingxiao; Inouye, David",Delayed response of spring phenology to global warming in subtropics and tropics,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,,0168-1923,10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.01.002,,"Climate drivers of plant phenology in the subtropics and tropics are still unclear, which significantly hinders accurate prediction of climate change impacts on vegetation growth and carbon balance in these unique ecoregions. The basic hypothesis of process-based phenology models is that spring tree phenology is regulated by temperature and triggered by chilling temperatures during the dormancy period, followed by forcing temperatures during the growth period. That is, trees require cool temperatures during a chilling period to break endodormancy, and then enter the phase of ecodormancy during which the rate of ontogenetic development increases with increasing air temperature. Therefore, insufficient chilling requirements may slow bud growth and consequently delay budburst. Many studies have shown that chilling requirement is at present sufficient to release bud dormancy fully in temperate regions, and thus forcing temperatures play a dominant role in triggering spring tree phenology. To identify differences in mechanisms of spring tree phenology responses to air temperature between the subtropics/tropics and the temperate zone, and their possible effects on future phenological trends under global warming, we used leaf unfolding and flowering data from a tree species of tropical origin, Melia azedarach, and output daily mean air temperature data from a regional climate model (HadGEM3-RA) for the period 1981-2005 at 42 stations in southeastern China to fit unified forcing and chilling phenology models. Then, we selected optimum models for each phenophase at each station. Moreover, we predicted leafing and flowering dates across the research region over 2021-2100 under global climate warming scenarios. The results show a previously unreported phenological phenomenon: chilling will often be insufficient to break bud dormancy in the northern tropical zone and may become a crucial factor limiting leafing and flowering responses to spring warming. However, chilling will still be sufficient to break bud dormancy in the warm temperate zone, and thus may not limit leafing and flowering responses to spring warming there. Consequently, predicted leafing and flowering dates both will be delayed in the northern tropical zone but will advance in the warm temperate zone from 2021 to 2100. In the subtropical zone, the effect of chilling temperature on spring phenology will be reduced gradually from earlier to later phenophases. Thus, predicted leafing and flowering dates show decreased delaying trends and increased advancing trends from earlier to later phenophases in the subtropical zone. Our findings suggest that insufficient chilling temperature accumulation during the dormancy period may counteract the forcing temperature accumulation during the growth period in the northern tropical zone and parts of the subtropical zone, resulting in delayed leafing and flowering dates.

We explored phenological patterns in Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park (HNNP) in China and their major climatic and biotic drivers, based on phenological and distribution data for >2000 species from the Flora of Hainan. Specifically, we address the following questions: (1) What are the phenological patterns for all species in HNNP and for Hainan gibbon food plants only? (2) What are the environmental drivers of reproductive phenology? (3) Whether the flowering and fruiting dates are phylogenetic conserved? (4) Does reproductive phenology vary with functional groups, like growth forms, pollination modes and fruit types? Our results show flowering peaks in late spring and early summer, while fruiting phenology was concentrated during late summer and fall. Closely related species tend to have similar flowering and fruiting dates. The number of flowering species was primary controlled by mean maximum monthly temperature while minimum monthly temperature was the most important variable in shaping fruiting patterns of all species. For fruiting of gibbon food plants, mean monthly precipitation was the most important variable. Our study found January to May was food shortage period, which has important implications for Hainan gibbon conservation. We should take targeted ecological restoration by planting gibbon food species with phenologies between January and May, and take targeted provisioning to attract gibbons into a new habitat by providing fruits between January and May.

In contrast, plants growing in wet tropical forests are freed from many abiotic constraints, which in canopy tree communities lead to a rich diversity of phenological patterns within and among individuals, species and communities. However, basic descriptions of tropical phenological patterns and the processes that shape them are rare. Here, we document the individual-, population-, and landscape-level phenological patterns of two dominant families of understory woody plants important to avian frugivores, the Melastomataceae and Rubiaceae, along an elevational transect in Costa Rica. The 226 individual plants belonging to 35 species in this study, varied in the number of reproductive bouts/year, and the timing, duration, and synchrony of reproductive stages. This variation was not related to factors related to their interactions with mutualists and antagonists, nor did it appear to be constrained by phylogeny. Diverse phenological patterns among species led to relatively aseasonal patterns at the community and landscape level. Overall, evidence for biotic processes shaping temporal patterns of fruiting phenology was weak or absent. These findings reveal a number of unexplained patterns, and suggest that factors shaping phenology in relatively aseasonal forests operate in idiosyncratic ways at the species level. Rev. Biol.

Here, we present a new model framework able to predict the timing of multiple annual flowering events from census data. We extend a recent model, which predicted tropical flowering probabilities as discrete events occurring on census dates, by integrating predicted flowering probabilities over all dates between censuses. We evaluate our model against 29 years of daily climate and weekly flowering records for Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae) and Handroanthus guayacan (Bignoniaceae) from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Previous experiments demonstrate that both species flower shortly after a heavy, dry-season rain interrupts an extended dry period. Our model captures this sequence of rainfall events. Best-fit model parameters are consistent with previous experimental results.

We found that, although the drought increased fruiting activity in the community relative to the reference plot, species-level response was varied in both phenology and physiology. Climate change is expected to increase the intensity and occurrence of drought in tropical regions, potentially affecting the phenology and physiology of tree species. Phenological activity may respond to a drying and warming environment by advancing reproductive timing and/or diminishing the production of flowers and fruits. These changes have the potential to disrupt important ecological processes, with potentially wide-ranging effects on tropical forest function. Here, we analysed the monthly flowering and fruiting phenology of a tree community (337 individuals from 30 species) over 7 years in a lowland tropical rainforest in northeastern Australia and its response to a throughfall exclusion drought experiment (TFE) that was carried out from 2016 to 2018 (3 years), excluding approximately 30% of rainfall. We further examined the ecophysiological effects of the TFE on the elemental (C:N) and stable isotope (& delta;13C and & delta;15N) composition of leaves, and on the stable isotope composition (& delta;13C and & delta;18O) of stem wood of four tree species. At the community level, there was no detectable effect of the TFE on flowering activity overall, but there was a significant effect recorded on fruiting and varying responses from the selected species. The reproductive phenology and physiology of the four species examined in detail were largely resistant to impacts of the TFE treatment. One canopy species in the TFE significantly increased in fruiting and flowering activity, whereas one understory species decreased significantly in both. There was a significant interaction between the TFE treatment and season on leaf C:N for two species. Stable isotope responses were also variable among species, indicating species-specific responses to the TFE. Thus, we did not observe consistent patterns in physiological and phenological changes in the tree community within the 3 years of TFE treatment examined in this study.",01/01/2023,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,,,1,11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article",,,,flowering; drought; Climate change; fruiting; stable isotopes; water use efficiency; Wet Tropics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work aims to document the phenological diversity of flowering and fruiting with reference to leafing events in Indian dry-tropical tree species. Methods Nine tree species, including one leaf-exchanging and eight deciduous showing varying leafless periods, were studied. Monthly counts of leaves, flowers and fruits were made on 160 tagged twigs on ten individuals of each species for initiation, completion and duration of different phenological events through two annual cycles. Key Results Variation in flowering relative to leaf flushing (which occurred just prior to or during a hot, dry summer) revealed five flowering types: summer flowering (on foliated shoots), rainy-season flowering (on foliated shoots following significant rains), autumn flowering (on shoots with mature leaves), winter flowering (on shoots undergoing leaf fall) and dry-season flowering (on leafless shoots). Duration of the fruiting phenophase was shortest (3-4 months) in dry-season and winter-flowering species, 6-9 months in rainy-and autumn-flowering species, and maximum (11 months) in summer-flowering species. A wide range of time lag (< 1 to > 8 months) between the start of vegetative (first-leaf flush) and reproductive (first-visible flower) phases was recorded in deciduous species; this time lag was correlated with the extent of the leafless period. A synthesis of available phenological information on 119 Indian tropical trees showed that summer-flowering species were most abundant (56% of total species) amongst the five types recognized. Conclusions The wide diversity of seasonal flowering and fruiting with linkages to leaf flush time and leafless period reflect the fact that variable reproductive and survival strategies evolved in tree species under a monsoonic bioclimate. Flowering periodicity has evolved as an adaptation to an annual leafless period and the time required for the fruit to develop. The direct relationship between leafless period (inverse of growing period) and time lag between onset of vegetative and reproductive phases reflects the partitioning of resource use for supporting these phases. Predominance of summer flowering coupled with summer leaf flushing seems to be a unique adaptation in trees to survive under a strongly seasonal tropical climate.",2006-02,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,265-276,,2,97,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article",,,,flowering types; fruiting; tropical tree phenology; asynchrony; leafless period; semi-evergreen species; summer flowering; summer leaf flushing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 357 individuals of 76 species (70 genera, 37 families), comprising of 59 (78%) woody trees and 17 (22%) shrub species were observed. Our results demonstrate that flowering and fruiting frequencies show slight temporal variation between years. Flowering was significantly correlated with day-length, temperature and rainfall and fruiting was significantly correlated with rainfall and temperature. This finding indicates that woody tree reproductive phenology was primarily associated with temperature and rainfall and to a lesser extent with day-length. Reproductive phenology is also linked to seasonal patterns with flowering peaking in the late dry season and fruiting peaking in the late wet season. Moreover, reproductive phenology is also significantly associated with reproductive ecological guilds such as pollination types and dispersal modes.

We observed the following phenological patterns throughout the northern Neotropics: wide-ranging trees flush or flower twice a year at the Equator, but annually further north; many trees leaf out in February; in autumn, wide-ranging perennials flower 4 months earlier in Mexico than at the Equator. This latitudinal variation of phenology parallels that of the annual cycle of daily insolation, a function of day length and solar irradiation. Insolation has two annual maxima at the Equator, it rapidly increases in February at all latitudes, and between Mexico and the Equator its maximum shifts from the summer solstice to the autumn equinox.

The presence of buds, Bowers, and fruit was noted over a 30-month period, from September 1992 to February 1995. Surveys were undertaken at: monthly intervals for the less common species, and at bimonthly intervals for ten of the common trees and tall shrubs. The majority of species flowered each year at about the same time. There was no evidence of sub-annual or continuous regimes of reproductive phenology. There was no supra-annual carryover of seed-bearing fruit in the canopy of any species. The peak flowering periods were the mid to late dry season (July-August) and the transition between the dry season and the wet season (October-November). The two dominant trees–Eucalyptus miniata and E. tetrodonta–flowered during the dry season, thereby providing resources for some elements of the vertebrate Fauna. Flowering and fruiting were uncommon at the end of the wet season (February/March), although two species that flower and fruit ar this time (E. porrecta and Terminalia ferdinandiana) may provide resources to consumers at a time when floral or fruit resources are otherwise scarce. Because the peak of reproductive activity takes place during the late dry season, fruit maturity and seed dispersal have occurred prior to the onset of the rainy season for most species, and germination and seedling establishment potentially may take effect in response to the first rains. Late dry season fires, which tend to be extensive and incense, are a potential threat to the floral and fruit reserves within these savannas.",1999-12,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,626-636,,4,31,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA Publisher: ASSOC TROPICAL BIOLOGY INC Type: Article",,,,phenology; synchrony; trees; fire; Eucalyptus; northern Australia; savanna; serotiny; wet-dry tropics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A long-term (12 yr) survey of flowering in 254 lowland tropical rain forest trees of 173 species from the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica showed highly diverse, irregular, and complex patterns. Analysis of this survey data relied primarily on graphical analyses that provide data representation methods rather than numerical summaries that provide data reduction methods. The classification differs from previous ones in three ways. It uses, as the primary criterion, frequency of the time series, based on explicit time and amplitude scales, so that irregular temporal sequences are revealed. It features a system of subsidiary classes based on other quantitative descriptors: regularity, duration, amplitude, date, and synchrony. Finally, the conceptual framework separates patterns at each level of analysis so that adding the time series at one level produces a time series for the next higher level. Levels are hierarchical from the flower to the individual, population, and community with additional non-nested levels such as the guild. The four basic classes-continual, subannual, annual, and supra-annual-are applied to patterns at any level of analysis. The classification system provides a logical framework for quantitative description of phenological behavior leading to more standardized comparisons. Thus we can see that tropical phenology differs from temperate phenology in two major ways. In tropical species, the nature of the pattern may change from one level of analysis to the next, which is not typical of temperate species. In many tropical species, phenological patterns vary more widely over the geographic range of a species than they do in temperate species.",1994-06,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,141-159,,2,26,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN 2345 TOWER GROVE AVE, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 Publisher: ASSN TROP BIOL Type: Article",,,,PHENOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNITY; FLOWERING; GUILD; INDIVIDUAL; LA-SELVA-BIOLOGICAL-STATION; LOWLAND TROPICAL RAIN FOREST; POPULATION; TROPICAL TREES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Species-specific flowering periods of herbarium collections are similar to those observed in phenological field studies, but are often longer because of the larger geographical and temporal sampling range. Conspecific collections of different geographical origin show distinct differences in flowering periodicity, which are correlated with differences in the timing and intensity of the dry season. Interspecific differences in the timing of phenology relative to the dry season indicate differences in the control of phenology by seasonal drought.

The phenological study was realized in a protected area with tropical dry forest of the Central Depresion from Chiapas. Fifty adult trees of each specie were selected and the intensity of four reproductive phenophases (flower bud, open flower, fruit development and permanence of fruits) and three vegetative ones (leaf bud, mature leaves, senescence) were recorded using the Fournier method.

Phenological patterns are most diverse and least understood in the tropics. In those parts of tropical Asia where low temperature or drought impose a seasonal rest period, regular annual cycles of growth and reproduction predominate at the individual, population, and community level. In aseasonal areas, individuals and populations show a range of sub- to supra-annual periodicities, with an overall supra-annual reproductive periodicity at the community level. There is no evidence for photoperiod control of phenology in the Asian tropics, and seasonal changes in temperature are a likely factor only near the northern margins. An opportunistic response to water availability is the simplest explanation for most observed patterns where water is seasonally limiting, while the great diversity of phenological patterns in the aseasonal tropics suggests an equal diversity of controls. The robustness of current phenological patterns to high interannual and spatial variability suggests that most plant species will not be seriously affected by the phenological consequences alone of climate change. However, some individual plant species may suffer, and the consequences of changes in plant phenology for flower- and fruit-dependent animals in fragmented forests could be serious.",1998-07,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,439-453,,02-Mar,39,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: World Wildlife Fund; Int Inst Trop Forestry Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Proceedings Paper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To resolve this apparent paradox, phenology and seasonal changes in tree water status were monitored during two consecutive dry seasons in > 150 trees of 37 species growing at different sites in the tropical dry lowland forest of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Tree development during the dry season varied considerably between species and between sites of different moisture availability. Leaf shedding, flowering, and shoot growth (flushing) were strongly correlated with seasonal changes in tree water status, measured by conventional and newly developed techniques. Tree water status varied with the availability of subsoil water and a variety of biotic factors such as structure and life-span of leaves, time of leaf shedding, wood density and capacity for stem water storage, and depth and density of root systems. Observed tree species differed widely in wood density (from 0.19 to 1.1 g/cm(3)) and stem water storage capacity (400-20% of dry mass), which was highly correlated with the degree of desiccation during drought. Only hardwood trees at dry upland sites, lacking stem water storage and access to subsoil water, desiccated strongly (stem water potential < -4 MPa) and remained inactive throughout the dry season. In all other trees elimination of transpirational water loss during leaf shedding in conjunction with utilization of residual water enabled rehydration of stem tissues and subsequent flowering or flushing during the dry season. Rate and degree of rehydration varied strongly with the availability of water stored in tree trunks or in the subsoil. Stored water buffers the impact of seasonal drought and enables flowering and flushing during the dry season. Climatic data are thus not sufficient to explain tree phenology in seasonally dry tropical forests. Phenology, seasonal changes in water status, and water storage capacity of tree species are highly correlated. Tree species cluster into a number of distinct functional types ranging from deciduous hardwood trees and water-storing lightwood trees in dry upland forests to evergreen light- and softwood trees confined to moist lowland sites. Seasonal variation in tree water status thus appears to be the principal determinant of both phenology and distribution of tree species in tropical dry forests.",1994-07,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,1437-1449,,5,75,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,TROPICAL DRY FOREST; COSTA RICA; SEASONAL DROUGHT; SOIL WATER STORAGE; STEM WATER STORAGE; TREE PHENOLOGY; TREE WATER STATUS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, effective monitoring of flowering over various scales from individuals to forest ecosystem levels is lacking due to the relatively small sizes of flowers, diverse flowering strategies across species, and the short duration of flowering, making accurate flower detection difficult. Dronebased surveys require less time and human resources than traditional ground-based flower surveys and thus may be able to help address this in a cost-effective manner but remain underexplored in species-rich tropical forest ecosystems. Here, we developed a method that integrated the Residual Networks 50 (ResNet50) deep learning algorithm with high resolution imagery (c. 0.05 m) from monthly drone surveys done in a 50-ha tropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panam & PRIME;a, over 2018-2020 to detect a diversity of flowering species in this tree community and to track the timing of flowering throughout the year. We built a comprehensive training library of canopy components (flower, leaf, branch, and shade) from this forest plot throughout the study period, trained a single deep learning model across all drone imagery, and validated it using five-fold cross validation at the pixel scale. We further generated image- and tree-crown-specific supervised classifications to evaluate the deep learning model at the tree-crown scale. Our deep learning method accurately classified flowers (User's accuracy = 95.3 %, Producer's accuracy = 85.8 %) while maintaining high predictive power for the other three classes (Overall accuracy = 98.4 %). Our results also demonstrated high consistency against tree-crown-specific supervised classifications for flower (r2 = 0.85), leaf (r2 = 0.84), and branch (r2 = 0.92) components, with lower agreement observed for the shade component (r2 = 0.59). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in advancing fine-scale flower monitoring in the tropics, with potential to be extended to other regions or other remote sensing platforms with frequent high-resolution monitoring. The method will allow us to better monitor flowering in tropical forests and improve our understanding of how phenology and reproductive success may be affected by climate change.",2023-07,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,92-103,,,201,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",,,,Drone; Flower detection; Flower fraction; ResNet50; Tropical phenology; UAV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This increase can alter forest structure and decrease both carbon storage and tree diversity via antagonistic relationships between lianas and their host trees. Climate change is postulated as an underlying driver of increasing liana abundances, via increases in dry-season length, forest-disturbance events, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations; all factors thought to favour lianas. However, the impact of climate change on liana reproductive phenology, an underlying determinant of liana abundance, has been little studied, particularly outside of Neotropical forests. Over a 15-year period (2000-2014), we examined the phenological patterns of a liana community in intact rainforests of the Wet Tropics bioregion of Australia; a World Heritage Area and hotspot of floral diversity. Specifically, we assessed (1) flowering and fruiting patterns of liana species; (2) potential climate drivers of flowering and fruiting activity; and (3) the influence of El Nino-related climatic disturbances on liana phenology. We found that flowering and fruiting of the studied liana species increased over time. Liana reproduction, moreover, rose in apparent response to higher temperatures and reduced rainfall. Finally, we found flowering and fruiting of the liana species increased following El Nino events. These results suggest that liana reproduction and abundance are likely to increase under predicted future climate regimes, with potentially important impacts on the survival, growth, and reproduction of resident trees and thus the overall health of Australian tropical rainforests.",09/06/2022,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",,,,flowering; fruiting; ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation); forest disturbance; rainforest; woody vines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Species were either deciduous with synchronous or asynchronous leaf drop, or evergreen with continuous or seasonal leaf flushing. Flowering occurred supra-annually, annually, or continuously.

Two hypotheses were tested: (1) Interspecific synchronization of flowering and fruiting phenology is higher at study sites with pronounced rainfall seasonality compared with sites within perhumid forests. (2) Proximate causes for flowering in closely situated seasonal and perhumid sites are either photoperiodicity or climatic factors. Two nearby study sites with contrasting precipitation patterns were selected at the same altitude east and west of the western Cordillera. Eighty trees from 13 species were observed over a 2.5-y period. Three species were common to both study sites. Phenological and climate data were collected and cross-correlated by conducting a time-series analysis. At the perhumid site, very clear annual patterns of phenological behaviour could be observed for most of the selected rain-forest tree species, but with a poor interspecific synchronization. On the nearby seasonal site in contrast, most species showed high synchrony in their phenological behaviour coinciding with the dry season. There is strong evidence that flowering is induced not by one factor alone: we identified photoperiodic control, radiation and precipitation as possible proximate causes for both sites.

Extensive and long-term phenological observations in the tropics are rare and difficult to realise but unpublished historical records have been preserved and are of high value. Phenological data gathered between 1948 and 1957 on 3642 trees of 158 species in the rainforest reserve of Luki, Democratic Republic of Congo were analysed. Patterns of leaf shedding, flowering, fruiting and fruit dispersal were presented for three major functional groups of trees and their relationships with rainfall investigated. Annual rhythms of leaf and reproductive phenology were observed with patterns ranging from synchronous annual peaks to continuity. Over the years, positive association was found between leaf shedding and annual rainfall for shade-tolerant canopy species as well as between reproductive phenology and annual rainfall for long-lived heliophilous and shade-tolerant understorey species. Direct and indirect associations with intra-annual and supra-annual climate variations suggest that changes in environmental conditions may affect phenological patterns of tropical trees thus species interactions and ecosystem dynamics. The different leaf and reproductive phenological patterns found in different functional groups of trees promote the coexistence of numerous tree species in tropical rainforest multispecies communities.

We documented leaf and reproductive phenology of 14 shrubs, and irrigated a further 15, to determine if soil moisture affected leafiness and reproductive activity. Brachychiton megaphyllus showed first flower buds shortly after the cessation of wet-season rains, and budded and flowered throughout the dry season. In some plants, leaf flush occurred prior to the first rains. Rates of fruit set and maturity were very low. Irrigation did not significantly influence leaf shoot or subsequent canopy development. Contrary to expectation, irrigation decreased the production of buds and flowers though it had no impact on the production of fruit, a response for which we suggest a number of hypotheses. Phenological responses to irrigation may have been limited because B. megaphyllus responds primarily to cues other than soil moisture and is buffered against seasonal drought by a large tap root.

Because of the strong positional differentiation within tree crowns and the repetition of vegetative and reproductive growth cycles in trees, flower develoment and its control are more complex than in herbaceous plants. Formation of terminal inflorescences, as found in Cedrela, Cordia and Tabebuta, regularly occurs at the end of a flush of determinate shoot growth; flower initiation, like shoot growth cessation, is controlled by internal, correlative factors rather than by environmental changes. Initiation of lateral inflorescences is usually preceded by growth cessation in the indeterminate, vegetative shoot, but the timing and control of flower induction in lateral buds are unknown. For many tropical trees, particularly those growing in seasonal climates, flower development is discontinuous, i.e., flower initiation and anthesis are separated by a prolonged rest period and must be controlled separately. Delayed anthesis is usually triggered by rehydration of previously water-stressed trees resulting from leaf shedding or, in dry habitats, by rainfall. Because of different degrees of seasonal water stress, leaf fall and subsequent anthesis in several species extend over 3-4 mo. The observed periodicity of anthesis in tropical trees is thus largely determined by seasonal changes in tree water status and is unlikely to be the result of selection for optimum tree-pollinator interaction.",1983,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,81-89,,2,15,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In tropical forests, studies that document epiphyte reproductive phenology are relatively few because of the challenges of tracking plants that live in the canopy. Phenological patterns for 279 individuals of 7 epiphyte species were examined across 12 months in a tropical montane forest in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Epiphytes were located in one of two common tree species, Ficus tuerckheimii (Moraceae) or Ocotea tonduzii (Lauraceae). Flowering and fruiting (i.e., when ripe or unripe fruit is present on the plant) of study plants was recorded on monthly intervals, and phenology was examined as a function of the season at the study site (i.e., wet, transition, or dry season), and pollinator syndrome (bird-, or insect-pollinated) and seed dispersal syndrome (bird-, bat-, or wind-dispersed) of each plant. Though some epiphyte species flowered and fruited throughout the year, the majority showed significant seasonality in phenological events. Based on circular statistics, the timing of mean flowering of different epiphyte species varied, however, timing of mean fruiting for most species tended to occur during the wet season. Insect- and bird-pollinated species had peak flowering during the dry season and late wet season, respectively. Bird-dispersed fruits were present each month of the year with peaks from February to October and again in December. Wind-dispersed fruits were observed eight months of the year with a peak in the early wet season. The timing of epiphyte flowering coincided with flowering of large trees in the area.

Anomalously warm equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures affect rainfall and temperature throughout the tropics and coincide with altered leaf flush phenology and increased fruit production in wet tropical forests; however, the understanding of mechanisms underlying this pattern is limited. There is evidence that increases in tropical tree reproduction anticipate El Nino onset, motivating the continued search for a global driver of tropical angiosperm reproduction. We present the solar-wind energy flux hypothesis: that physical energy influx to the Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere, generated by a positive anomaly in the solar wind preceding El Nino development, cues tropical trees to increase resource allocation to reproduction. Methods We test this hypothesis using 19 years of data from Luquillo, Puerto Rico, correlating them with measures of solar-wind energy. Results From 1994 to 2013, the solar-wind energy flux into Earth's magnetosphere (E-in) was more strongly correlated with the number of species fruiting and flowering than the Nino 3.4 climate index, despite Nino 3.4 being previously identified as a driver of interannual increases in reproduction. Conclusions Changes in the global magnetosphere and thermosphere conditions from increased solar-wind energy affect global atmospheric pressure and circulation patterns, principally by weakening the Walker circulation. We discuss the idea that these changes cue interannual increases in tropical tree reproduction and act through an unidentified mechanism that anticipates and synchronizes the reproductive output of the tropical trees with El Nino.",2019-11,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,1519-1525,,11,106,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,flowering; reproductive phenology; fruiting; tropical trees; El Nino Southern Oscillation; Luquillo; solar wind; solar-wind energy flux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although our understanding of geographic variation in habitat-wide timing and frequency of flowering and fruiting is advancing, corresponding information for individual tree species is limited. Thus, we compared climate and reproductive phenology of 16 tree species over 70 mo at two Bornean tropical peat-swamp forest sites. We found significant inter-site correlations in rainfall and temperature, and only small absolute temperature differences. In both sites, most species exhibited within-site synchrony in flowering and fruiting onset. Broad-scale flowering and fruiting onset frequency classifications showed high congruence between sites. Significant correlations in flowering and fruiting onset timing between sites were found for only 19 and 17 percent of the species, respectively. This remained the case when applying 1- and 2-month lag periods for both sites, with neither site consistently lagging behind. Significant differences in the exact frequency of new flowering and fruiting events were detected for 44 and 58 percent of species, respectively, and no significant relationships between the onset timing synchrony and exact frequency of new reproductive events were found for either flowers or fruit. We conclude that inter-site climatic and ecological similarities do not necessarily lead to high inter-site synchrony in either onset timing or exact frequency of tree reproductive events. Potential reasons for this are discussed, as are the implications for understanding tropical forest ecology and improving forest restoration project seed collections. Abstrak Waktu dan frekuensi peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah adalah karakteristik utama hutan tropis yang berpengaruh besar pada fauna. Pemahaman kita mengenai variasi geografis waktu berdasarkan habitat dan frekuensi peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah memang semakin maju namun informasi terkait mengenai masing-masing jenis pohon masih terbatas.

Kami menemukan korelasi signifikan antara curah hujan dan suhu antarlokasi, dan hanya ada perbedaan kecil dalam hal suhu mutlak. Di kedua situs, sebagian besar spesies menunjukkan keserempakan waktu permulaan peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah di dalam situs masing-masing. Klasifikasi frekuensi waktu permulaan berbunga dan berbuah dalam skala luas menunjukkan kesesuaian yang tinggi antarlokasi. Korelasi signifikan dalam hal waktu permulaan peristiwa berbunga dan berbuah antarlokasi hanya ditemukan berturut-turut dalam 19 dan 17 persen spesies.

However, phenology data sets spanning many years are rare in the tropics, making it difficult to evaluate possible responses of tropical communities to climate change. Here we use two data sets (1970-1983 and 1990-2002) to describe the fruiting patterns of the tropical tree community in Kibate National Park, Uganda. To address variation in spatial patterns, we describe fruiting over 2-3 y among four sites each separated by 12-15 km. Presently, the Kibale region is receiving c. 300 min more rain than it did at the start of the century, droughts are less frequent, the onset of the rainy season is earlier. and the average maximum monthly temperature is 3.5degreesC hotter than it was 25 y ago. The 1990-2002 phenology data illustrated high temporal variability in the proportion of the populations fruiting. Interannual variation in community-wide fruit availability was also high; however, the proportion of trees that fruited has increased over the past 12 + y. At the species level a variety of patterns were exhibited; however, a number of the most common species currently rarely fruit, and when they do, typically < 41% of the individuals take part in fruiting events. Combining the data set from 1990 to 2002 with that from 1970 to 1983 for specific species again reveals an increase in the proportion of trees fruiting between 1990 and 2002: however, the proportion of the populations fruiting decreased during the earlier period. When one examines particular species over this whole period a variety of patterns are evident. For example, Pouteria altissima exhibited a relatively regular pattern of fruiting during the 1970s; however, it rarely fruited in the 1990s. Contrasting phenological patterns at four sites revealed that at the community level the fruiting patterns of only one of the six pair-wise site combinations were correlated. Relationships between rainfall and fruiting were variable among sites. Contrasting changes in fruiting patterns over the 30 y with differences among the four sites varying in rainfall, suggests that the changes observed in fruiting may be due to climate change. Responses to this climate change are likely complex and will vary among species. However, for some species, current conditions appear unsuitable for fruiting.",2005-01,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,31-45,,1,21,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article",,,,climate change; seasonality; flowering; fruiting; tropical trees; Kibale National Park; phenology; seed dispersal; Uganda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used data from 302 tree species in a wet tropical forest to test a series of predictions regarding timing, duration, and frequency of flowering and examined the effect of each variable on the other two. Because timing, duration, and frequency of flowering can be constrained by phylogeny, we analyzed the data before and after considering phylogenetic effects at the level of family. Flowering activity peaked in the first wet season from May to July, refuting our prediction of peak flowering during the dry season. Our prediction that most species should flower several times a year was supported when species flowering more or less continually throughout the year were included in this category. Our prediction that supra-annually flowering species should be the least frequent was also supported with some qualifications. As we predicted, species flowering several times a year bloomed relatively briefly per flowering episode. Our prediction of shorter flowering duration for species flowering in the dry season and for those with a temporal separation between flowering and vegetative growth was also supported. Furthermore, supra-annually flowering species flowered for a shorter duration than annually flowering species and had a higher probability of flowering in the dry season compared to episodically or annually flowering species.

We measure the flowering phenology of big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla, Meliaceae), a widely distributed neotropical tree, and explore how disturbance from logging impacts its reproductive biology. Methods: We use a crown scoring system to estimate the timing and duration of population-level flowering at three forest sites in the Brazilian Amazon over a five-year period. We combine this information with data on population structure and spatial distribution to consider the implications of logging for population flowering patterns and reproductive success. Key results: Mahogany trees as small as 14 cm diam flowered, but only trees > 30 cm diam flowered annually or supra-annually. Mean observed flowering periods by focal trees ranged from 18-34 d, and trees flowered sequentially during 3-4 mo beginning in the dry season. Focal trees demonstrated significant interannual correlation in flowering order. Estimated population-level flowering schedules resembled that of the focal trees, with temporal isolation between early and late flowering trees. At the principal study site, conventional logging practices eliminated 87% of mahogany trees > 30 cm diam and an estimated 94% of annual pre-logging floral effort. Conclusions: Consistent interannual patterns of sequential flowering among trees create incompletely isolated subpopulations, constraining pollen flow. After harvests, surviving subcommercial trees will have fewer, more distant, and smaller potential partners, with probable consequences for post-logging regeneration. These results have important implications for the sustainability of harvesting systems for tropical timber species.",2013-11,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,2293-2305,,11,100,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,reproductive phenology; tropical trees; synchronous flowering; logging impacts; Meliaceae; population genetic structure; sustainable forest management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such aseasonal tropics, it was found that plant population density is associated with flowering intervals within the same habitats and within the same pollination guilds, if some conditions are satisfied. This finding is based on observations of flowering phenology of butterfly-pollinated understory shrubs of the genus Ixora (Rubiaceae) for 36 months in a mixed dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, northwest Borneo. Plants did not receive sufficient pollination services and fruit set was pollination-limited. Under such conditions, it is theoretically predicted that the plant types that reproduce frequently would have higher population density than those that reproduce less frequently, because common types must avoid competition for pollinators and rare types can have a large floral display by storing resources during long reproductive intervals to attract pollinators efficiently. Observed relationships among plant reproductive intervals, pollinator attractions and population densities in Ixora are consistent with theoretical predictions.

Changing the normal seasonal flowering cycle offers growers considerable economic advantages, by enhancing the ability to market tropical fruit in the off-season. A grower can cycle different blocks of trees to provide continuous employment for workers, schedule production to avoid the peak periods when gluts occur and often the price is less than the production costs, and can accept orders to deliver fruit at a future date. The practices used to modify the timing of flowering also offers the opportunity to improve product quality and reduced cull losses when coupled with practices such as fruit thinning and bagging. Cold temperatures and photoperiodism determine flower induction in temperate, and subtropical growing areas. The cold season in the subtropics often leads mango, for example, to have only one flowering cycle per year, whereas in the tropics, it might flower two to three times per year. The phenology of many tropical fruit crops and some temperate crops when grown in the tropics can be modified by production practices such as the fertilization and irrigation, pruning and chemical treatments. However, differences occur in the varietal responses to these modified practices. The classic example of a change in the seasonal timing of flowering is pineapple, after it was observed that smoke induced off-season flowering in this photoperiodic species. Water stress and fertilization timing frequently play a significant role in modifying seasonal flowering patterns in tropical species, as does girdling, shading, roots pruning and chemical treatments to stimulate and inhibit growth. Plant growth regulators and inhibitors are used to hasten the completion of the natural phenological vegetative and root growth phases and prepare the tree for flowering. The modification of the natural phenological cycles has raised concerns by some orchardists and researchers that the tree's useful life might be reduced. The reduction in a tree's productive life due to cycling can incur additional expenses to replant and wait for the new planting to mature and produce fruit. It would be necessary to balance the cost of replanting, if needed, with the advantages from cycling trees to achieve higher fruit prices. Examples of crops where flowering and fruiting cycles have been modified, include; carambola, durian, grape, guava, longan, mango, pineapple, rambutan, sweetsop and wax apple. The potential also exists to tailor production practices in other tropical fruit crops to allow year-round marketing of high quality tropical fruit.",2018,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,191-201,,,1205,,,,Acta Horticulturae,,,,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: Int Soc Horticultural Sci ISSN: 0567-7572 Type: Proceedings Paper,,,,flowering; phenology; flower induction; marketing; tropical fruit,,"Drew, R",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the community level, bimodal fruiting pattern prevailed, with a major peak in the dry season and a minor one in the early rainy season. An annual fruiting pattern was observed in many species and among the studied species fruiting lasted for 2-9 months. There was no significant difference in the frequency of species at three fruiting stages across the life-form categories and many species of upper and lower canopy trees and lianas were in the ripe fruiting phase during the late dry season. Plant physiognomic groups displayed distinct seasonality in fruiting pattern. The fruit maturation period was much longer for the wet season fruiting brevideciduous species than evergreen and deciduous species that fruited during the dry season. The variation in timing of fruiting behaviour among zoochorous species demonstrated less seasonality and zoochorous fruits were available throughout the year. Fruiting in anemochorous species peaked during the driest months and dryness favoured the dissemination of seeds. The fruiting patterns observed in the studied tropical dry evergreen forest across various plant traits were comparable with patterns recorded in other tropical seasonal forests.

Leaf shedding of two species was observed for 12 months. Parallel to the phenological recordings, meteorological parameters were monitored in detail and related to the flowering and fruiting activity of the trees. In spite of the perhumid climate of that area, a high degree of intra- and inter-specific synchronisation of phenological traits was apparent. With the exception of one species that flowered more or less continuously, two groups of trees could be observed, one of which flowered during the less humid months (September to October) while the second group started to initiate flowers towards the end of that phase and flowered during the heavy rains (April to July). As reflected by correlation coefficients, the all-time series of meteorological parameters showed a distinct seasonality of 8-12 months, apparently following the quasi-periodic oscillation of precipitation and related cloudiness. As revealed by power spectrum analysis and Markov persistence, rainfall and minimum temperature appear to be the only parameters with a periodicity free of long-term variations. The phenological events of most of the plant species showed a similar periodicity of 8-12 months, which followed the annual oscillation of relatively less and more humid periods and thus was in phase or in counter-phase with the oscillations of the meteorological parameters. Periods of unusual cold or dryness, presumably resulting from underlying longer-term trends or oscillations (such as ENSO), affected the homogeneity of quasi-12-month flowering events, fruit maturation and also the production of germinable seeds. Some species show underlying quasi-2-year-oscillations, for example that synchronise with the development of air temperature; others reveal an underlying decrease or increase in flowering activity over the observation period, influenced for instance by solar irradiance. As Ecuador suffers the highest rate of deforestation in South America, there is an urgent need for indigenous plant material for reforestation.

Rhododendron buxifolium bloomed extensively every March-May at the main plot but the flowering pattern at the subplot was less predictable. Mass flowering occurred in March 1998 when drought stress was very severe due to an El Nino event. Rhododendron ericoides showed continuous flowering throughout the year and high synchrony between the plots. Extensive flowering of Leptospermum recurvuin occurred synchronously within and between plots in the early half of 1999, then flowering activity decreased greatly. Photinia davidiana showed an annual flowering cycle but the timing of the peak flowering differed between the plots. Vaccinium stapfianum showed synchronous flowering between the plots and the flowering peak appeared at longer than 1-y intervals. Plant size was positively correlated with mean flower production in all species, and with the flowering frequency of R. ericoides, R. buxifoilium, and V. stapfianum at one of the plots at least. Two fleshy-fruited species, P. davidiana and V. stapfianum, had high selfing ability for fruit production and showed relatively low flowering synchrony among individuals in comparison with the other species.

We continue investigating the factors that drive phenological diversity on a wide scale, but we are unaware of the variation of plant reproductive phenology at a fine spatial scale despite the high spatial variation in species composition and abundance in tropical rainforests. We addressed fine scale variability by investigating the reproductive phenology of three contiguous vegetations across the Atlantic rainforest coastal plain in Southeastern Brazil. We asked whether the vegetations differed in composition and abundance of species, the microenvironmental conditions and the reproductive phenology, and how their phenology is related to regional and local microenvironmental factors. The study was conducted from September 2007 to August 2009 at three contiguous sites: (1) seashore dominated by scrub vegetation, (2) intermediary covered by restinga forest and (3) foothills covered by restinga pre-montane transitional forest. We conducted the microenvironmental, plant and phenological survey within 30 transects of 25 mx4 m (10 per site). We detected significant differences in floristic, microenvironment and reproductive phenology among the three vegetations. The microenvironment determines the spatial diversity observed in the structure and composition of the flora, which in turn determines the distinctive flowering and fruiting peaks of each vegetation (phenological diversity). There was an exchange of species providing flowers and fruits across the vegetation complex. We conclude that plant reproductive patterns as described in most phenological studies (without concern about the microenvironmental variation) may conceal the fine scale temporal phenological diversity of highly diverse tropical vegetation. This phenological diversity should be taken into account when generating sensor-derived phenologies and when trying to understand tropical vegetation responses to environmental changes.",2011-11,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,843-854,,6,55,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Proceedings Paper",,,,Seasonality; Microenvironmental factors; Phenological diversity; Resource availability; Tropical forest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Observations on flowering, fruiting, leaf fall, and leaf flushing were recorded monthly, during 16 months (April 2003 to July 2004). All species with a ground level perimeter > 10 cm and represented by at least three individuals, were selected and tagged. A total of 51 species represented by 156 individuals were recorded. Leaf flushing and leaf fall did not have seasonal variation and the species continued to gain and loose leaves during the dry (August to February) and rainy (March to July) seasons.

Reproductive strategies were diverse, and no single regular cycle was found in >50% of individuals across all 12 sites. Additionally, we found annual flowering and fruiting cycles to be the most common. Sub-annual cycles were the next most common for flowering, whereas supra-annual patterns were the next most common for fruiting.

Here, we evaluate three types of data for this purpose, comparing scatterometry (QuikSCAT sigma(0)) and optical/near-infrared MODIS EVI remotely sensed data against field observations. At a site in Mozambique, the seasonal cycles from both space-borne sensors are in close agreement with each other and with estimates of tree plant area index derived from hemispherical photography (r > 0.88). This agreement results in similar estimates of the start of the growing season across different data types (range 13 days). Ku-band scatterometry may therefore be a useful complement to vegetation indices such as EVI for estimating the start of the growing season for trees in tropical woodlands. More broadly, across southern tropical Africa there is close agreement between scatterometry and EVI time series in woody ecosystems with > 25% tree cover, but in areas of < 25% tree cover, the two time series diverge and produce markedly different start of season (SoS) dates (difference > 50 days). This is due to increases in sigma(0) during the dry season, not matched by increase in EVI. The reasons for these increases are not obvious, but might relate to soil moisture, flowering, fruiting, or grass dynamics. Further observations and modeling of this phenomenon is warranted to understand the causes of these dry season changes in sigma(0). Finally, three different definitions of the SoS were examined and found to produce only small differences in estimated dates, across all types of data.",2014-01,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,519-528,,"1, 2",52,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article",,,,Canopy phenology; land surface phenology (LSP); scatterometry; start of season,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two sites, a wetter site I receiving 1100mm and a drier site II receiving 600mm of rainfall annually, are compared. A total of 286 trees from 38 species at site I and 167 trees from 27 species at site II was marked for phenological observations. There were 11 species common to the two sites. Several hypotheses relating to the evolution of reproductive phenology are tested. 2 Frequency of species flowering attained a peak at site I during the dry season but at site II, where soil moisture may be limiting during the dry months, the peak was during the wet season. At both sites a majority of species flushed leaves and flowered simultaneously. Among various guilds, the bird-pollinated guild showed distinct dry season flowering, which may be related to better advertisement of large flowers to pollinators during the leafless dry phase. The wind-pollinated guild flowered mainly during the wet season, when wind speeds are highest and favourable for pollen transport. The insect-pollinated guild showed no seasonality in flowering in site I but a wet season flowering in site II. 3 Fruiting frequency attained a peak in site I during the late wet season extending into the early dry season; a time-lag correlation showed that fruiting followed rainfall with a lag of about two months. Site II showed a similar fruiting pattern but this was not statistically significant. The dispersal guilds (animal, wind, and explosive passively-dispersed) did not show any clear seasonality in fruiting, except for the animal-dispersed guild which showed wet season fruiting in site I. 4 Hurlbert's overlap index was also calculated in order to look at synchrony in flowering and fruiting irrespective of climatic (dry and wet month) seasonality. In general, overlap in flowering and fruiting guilds was high because of seasonal aggregation. Among the exceptions, at site II the wind-pollinated flowering guild did not show significant overlap between species although flowering aggregated in the wet season. This could be due to the need to avoid heterospecific pollen transfer. 5 Rarer species tended to flower earlier in the dry season and this again could be an adaptation to avoid the risk of heterospecific pollen transfer or competition for pollinators. The more abundant species flowered mainly during the wet season. Species which flower earlier have larger flowers and, having invested more energy in flowers, also have shorter flower to fruit durations.",1994-12,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,759-767,,4,82,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL Publisher: BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD Type: Article",,,,COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; FRUITING PHENOLOGY; MUDUMALAI SANCTUARY; POLLINATION AND DISPERSAL GUILDS; SOUTHERN INDIA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to determine phenological patterns and their relation to climate for both deciduous and broadleaved-evergreen species. Lear fall, leaf Hush. flowering, and fruiting were recorded for 107 individuals belonging to twelve deciduous and twelve broadleaved-evergreen species. Phenological stages were scaled from 0 to 4 (referring to the proportion of each tree in a phenophase), and averaged monthly as a phenological index. Phenological periodicity was analysed as a nonmetric time-series using measures of predictability, constancy, and contingency. The climate is mild with a dry-cool season (November-March), a dry-warm season (April-May), and a wet-warm season (June-October). Foliar phenological patterns differed between deciduous and evergreen species. Deciduous species dropped leaves during the dry-cool season and leaf drop was negatively correlated with minimum temperature; leaf Hushing occurred during the dry-cool and dry-warm seasons and was positively correlated with maximum temperature. In general, broadleaved-evergreen species continually dropped and Hushed leaves throughout the year. Flowering and fruiting patterns did not differ between leaf habits. Mean flowering peaks occurred between February and May, but each individual species had a different annual peak. Fruiting occurred in the dry-warm and wet-warm seasons. Three species were distinct in their fruiting phenologies, Styrax and Meliosma exhibited supra-annual patterns, and Hedyosmum fruited most of the year.

Leaf flush was observed to increase at the end of the dry season with a peak during the rainy season. Similarly, the peak of flowering/fruiting occurred at the end of the dry and the beginning of the rainy season. Air humidity and maximum temperature were the only variables correlated with leaf flush. Most species showed annual flowering/fruiting.

We consider how existing, and emerging, tropical phenology monitoring programs can be made most effective by investigating major sources of noise in data collection at a long-term study site. Researchers at Lope NP, Gabon, have recorded monthly crown observations of leaf, flower and fruit phenology for 88 plant species since 1984. For a subset of these data, we first identified dominant regular phenological cycles, using Fourier analysis, and then tested the impact of observation uncertainty on cycle detectability, using expert knowledge and generalized linear mixed modeling (827 individual plants of 61 species). We show that experienced field observers can provide important information on major sources of noise in data collection and that observation length, phenophase visibility and duration are all positive predictors of cycle detectability. We find that when a phenological event lasts >4wk, an additional 10yr of data increases cycle detectability by 114 percent and that cycle detectability is 92 percent higher for the most visible events compared to the least. We also find that cycle detectability is four times as high for flowers compared to ripe fruits after 10yr. To maximize returns in the short-term, resources for long-term monitoring of phenology should be targeted toward highly visible phenophases and events that last longer than the observation interval. In addition, programs that monitor flowering phenology are likely to accurately detect regular cycles more quickly than those monitoring fruits, thus providing a baseline for future assessments of change. Resume La phenologie est un element cle du fonctionnement de l'ecosysteme et est de plus en plus incluse dans l'evaluation des changements ecologiques. Nous considerons comment les programmes de surveillance de la phenologie tropicale, aussi bien courants qu'emergents, peuvent etre rendus plus efficaces en etudiant les principales sources de bruit liees a la collecte de donnees sur un site d'etude a long terme.

The flowering was bimodal, with a highest peak in March and April, coinciding with the dry season, and a second lower peak in July when precipitation is relatively low. The highest number of fruiting tree species occur between May and July, with its peak in May. Each of the most common botanical families showed a particular phenological pattern.

Between June 2011 and December 2013, we investigated flowering, fruiting, and leafing patterns in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a montane forest located near the equator in Uganda, drawing on 16,410 observations of 530 trees of 54 species located between 2066 and 2527 m in elevation. The park's climate is equatorial with two wet and dry seasons each year. Flowering and fruiting were strongly seasonal while patterns in leafing were less pronounced. Flower occurrence peaked at the beginning of the short dry season followed by a pronounced trough during the beginning and the middle of the short wet season. Fruit occurrence had a pronounced peak during high rainfall months in March through April with most fruits ripening during drier months in May through July. Fruit scarcity was observed for a 4-month period spanning September to December and most flushing of leaves noted at the end of the wet season in November and December. Our binomial generalized linear mixed models indicated that flowering and fruiting were negatively associated with temperature and that leafing activity was positively associated with rainfall and temperature. These findings are consistent with the insolation- and water-limitation hypotheses suggesting that the seasonally varying availability of resources such as light, water, and nutrients determines these phenological patterns. Ideally, prolonged, multi-year community-level studies would be supported so as to better characterize the influence of climate and of climate variability.",2023-05,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,680-698,,3,55,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,flowering; fruiting; leaf flush; afromontane; leaf senescence; phenophase synchrony; tropical montane forest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The database was developed in the context of the e-phenology project and integrates ground-based conventional plant phenology direct observations with near-surface remote phenology using repeated images from digital cameras. It also includes site-base information, sensor derived data from the study site weather station and plant ecological traits (e.g., pollination and dispersal syndrome, flower and fruit color, and leaf exchange strategy) at individual and species level. We validated the database design through the implementation of a Web application that generates the time series based on queries, exemplified in two case studies investigating: the relationship between flowering phenology and local weather; and the consistency between leafing patterns derived from ground-based phenology on leaf flush and from vegetation image indices (%Green). The database will store all the information produced in the e-phenology project, monitoring of 12 sites from cerrado savanna to rainforest, and will aggregate the legacy information of other studies developed in the Phenology Laboratory (UNESP, Rio Claro, Brazil) over the last 20 years. We demonstrate that our database is a powerful tool that can be widely used to manage complex temporal datasets, integrating legacy and live phenological information from diverse sources (e.g., conventional, digital cameras, seed traps) and temporal scales, improving our capability of producing scientific and applied information on tropical phenology.

The tropical tree Manilkara zapota is a species from which non-timber products have been obtained for centuries by Mayan communities in Mexico. Nevertheless, there are no quantitative reports on its reproductive biology and the factors that limit fruit production. The present study describes the reproductive phenology, breeding system and pollination of this species in two contrasting environments: medium-height, subdeciduous forest, and homegardens (”solares”) in a Mayan community in the state of Yucatan. Significant differences were found between environments both in the temporal distribution of flower and mature fruit production, as well as in the proportion of mature fruits. Homegarden trees showed the greatest fruit production. although flower production did not differ between environments. Mature fruits were of better quality (i.e., greater fresh weight) in homegardens. Hand pollination experiments showed that M. zapota is self-compatible. and that there is pollinator limitation for fruit production in trees that grow in homegardens. We propose that water and soil nutrients are the main factors limiting M. zapota fruit production in forests, while in homegardens the main factor appears to be pollinator availability.

We chose two sites: one close to a permanent water source, locally known as `cenote' (the CC site, ground water table was found at 2 m) and the other far from the cenote (FC site ground water table was at a depth of 10 m). Sites mainly differed in soil depth (FC site having greater soil depth) and soil nutrient characteristics (FC site more potassium, CC site more phosphorous). Our results indicated significant differences in phenology within species between sites and years, with leaf, flower and fruit production tending to be higher at the CC site and in the year 2004. Wood density and xylem water potentials were negatively related to each other, and midday water potentials were higher at the CC site. Differences in phenology found among years suggest that the timing of rainfall as well as the duration of periods without rain may play a more important role in phenology than total annual precipitation. Also differences inter-sites suggest a strong effect of site on tree phenology.

In turn, many of these fauna are dependent on the flowering phenology of the plant species of such ecosystems. The impact of changes in climate, including climate extremes, on the interaction between these fauna and flora has not been identified or elucidated, yet influences on flowering phenology are already evident. These changes are well documented in the mid to high latitudes. However, there is emerging evidence that the flowering phenology, nectar/pollen production, and fruit production of long-lived trees in tropical and subtropical forests are also being impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of climate extremes. Here, we examine the implications of these changes for vertebrate fauna dependent on these resources. We review the literature to establish evidence for links between climate extremes and flowering phenology, elucidating the nature of relationships between different vertebrate taxa and flowering regimes. We combine this information with climate change projections to postulate about the likely impacts on nectar, pollen and fruit resource availability and the consequences for dependent vertebrate fauna. The most recent climate projections show that the frequency and intensity of climate extremes will increase during the 21st century. These changes are likely to significantly alter mass flowering and fruiting events in the tropics and subtropics, which are frequently cued by climate extremes, such as intensive rainfall events or rapid temperature shifts. We find that in these systems the abundance and duration of resource availability for vertebrate fauna is likely to fluctuate, and the time intervals between episodes of high resource availability to increase. The combined impact of these changes has the potential to result in cascading effects on ecosystems through changes in pollinator and seed dispersal ecology, and demands a focused research effort.",2015-09,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,3267-3277,,9,21,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Review",,,,flowering; fruiting; climate extremes; ecosystem processes; extreme climate events; frugivores; nectarivores; tree reproductive phenology; vertebrate species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the patterns of and controls on plant reproduction are crucial for conservation efforts under a changing global climate and rapidly expanding human development.

Overall fruit abundance generally declined through the dry season, but flower production increased between mid and late dry season. Variation in fruit and flower abundance among years was related to temperature and rainfall, but local site conditions-particularly successional stage and groundwater availability-explained more variability in reproductive activity than climate variation.

We aimed to investigate the relationship of leaf fall, leaf flushing, budding, flowering, immature and mature fruit phenophases with precipitation, temperature and photoperiod. We also analyzed whether the phenological patterns of tree community were seasonal and similar between consecutive years. Although the climate of the region is classified as Cfa, there are two distinct season: a hot humid summer and a cold drier winter. Leaf fall occurred predominantly in the dry season, with leaf flushing and flowering at the end of the dry and early wet season. The mature fruits were observed throughout the year. For the six phenophases analyzed, the percentage of species did not differ among the three study years. The tree community presented, in general, weakly seasonal phenological patterns, mainly in response to variations in temperature and photoperiod.

Without exception, recovery from water stress was required for flowering and shoot emergence. At dry sites rehydration occurred only after isolated rain showers or irrigation; at wet sites it took place during continued drought, probably as a consequence of the decrease in transpiration during leaf fall. Flowering was observed to occur at any time between the beginning (Dec.) and end (May) of the dry season. Differences in the timing and intensity of flowering as well as in the timing of leaf fall and shoot emergence can be accounted for by site-dependent differences in the rates of desiccation and rehydration of trees in conjunction with year-to-year variation in the timing and intensity of rainfall.

Leaf initiation was positively correlated with fruit senescence (r = 0.76, p < 0.01) and flower initiation (r = 0.63, p < 0.01). However, a negative correlation was found between leaf initiation (LF2) and leaf senescence (LF5) (r = -0.42, p < 0.05). Principal Component Analysis showed that maximum temperature and rainfall in a given month are the main factors for pre-monsoon events (leaf senescence and fruit senescence) and post-monsoon events (growth and maturation of leaves and fruits).

However, differences in soil physicochemical properties can also drive resource availability, potentially affecting plant phenology, especially under similar environments in terms of rainfall regime. We determined whether the seasonality and synchrony of the vegetative and reproductive phenophases differ along a grassland-savanna-forest gradient under the same climate regime in a Neotropical seasonal ecosystem. We hypothesized that species growing on shallow, nutrient-impoverished soils have a higher capacity to respond to precipitation pulses than those on rich soils. Location Serra do Cipo, southeastern Brazil. Methods We quantified soil physicochemical properties associated with fertility and water retention of the grassland (campo rupestre), savanna (cerrado) and forest, and determined the phenological strategies of 70 species across the three vegetation types by monitoring vegetative and reproductive phenophases over one year. For each phenophase, in each vegetation type, we evaluated the seasonality and synchrony of phenological patterns. We quantified the phylogenetic signal for phenophases to disentangle the relative roles of historical vs ecological drivers of plant phenology. Results Soils from campo rupestre were more nutrient- and water-limited than those of cerrado and forest. Cerrado and forest communities had similar phenological strategies, whereas species from campo rupestre showed strategies that maximize resource acquisition and conservation. In the cerrado and forest, leafing and flowering patterns were seasonal, with leaf flushing and flowering peaking at the onset of the rainy season and leaf senescence in the dry season. Conversely, species from campo rupestre showed continuous leafing and flowering patterns, while fruiting was seasonal. Phenophases did not show a phylogenetic signal. Conclusions We demonstrated changes in vegetative and reproductive phenology that are likely associated with variations in soil physicochemical properties.

Community-wide recruitment reached a maximum in the wet season, whereas no recruitment occurred during the dry season. We observed a unimodal peak in rainfall and fruit production, and the periodicity and intensity of seed production were significantly correlated with rainfall seasonality (the optimal time for germination). Flowering at the community and system levels lagged behind a significant increase and subsequent decrease in rainfall by 7 and 3 mo, respectively, indicating that the dominant factor controlling flowering periodicity is the passage of the major (4-mo long) rainy season and changes in soil moisture conditions. Fruiting lagged behind flowering by 2 mo and a significant increase in fruiting occurred 2 mo prior to a significant increase in rainfall. At the population level, a correspondence analysis identified a major dichotomy in the patterns of flowering and fruiting between species and indicated two broad species groups based oil their time of peak fruiting and the number of times they were in fruit. These were either individuals which were usually in peak fruit 1-2 mo prior to the start of the major rainy season or those that were in fruit more or less continuously throughout the year with no peak fruiting time.

Growth form was related to flowering time, and the pollination syndrome had a more significant relationship with flowering duration. Flowering time variation in the community was explained mainly by abiotic variables, without an important phylogenetic effect.

Location The four TDFs in Guanacaste (Costa Rica), Yucatan, Jalisco and Sonora (Mexico) are characterized by a 5-7 month long dry season and are located along a gradient of increasing latitude (10-30degreesN). Methods To dissect the differences in flowering periodicity observed at the community level, individual tree species were assigned to `flowering types', i.e. groups of species with characteristic flowering periods determined by similar combinations of environmental flowering cues and vegetative phenology. Results Large variation in the fraction of species and flowering types blooming during the dry and wet season, respectively, indicates large differences in the severity of seasonal drought among the four forests. In the dry upland forests of Jalisco, flowering of leafless trees remains suppressed during severe seasonal drought and is triggered by the first rains of the wet season. In the other forests, leaf shedding, exceptional rainfall or increasing daylength cause flowering of many deciduous species at various times during the dry season, well before the summer rains. The fraction of deciduous species leafing out during the summer rains and flowering when leafless during the dry season is largest in the Sonoran TDF. Main conclusions In many wide-ranging species the phenotypic plasticity of flowering periodicity is large. The distinct temporal separation of spring flowering on leafless shoots and subsequent summer flushing represents a unique adaptation of tree development to climates with a relatively short rainy season and a long dry season. Seasonal variation in rainfall and soil water availability apparently constitutes not only the proximate, but also the ultimate cause of flowering periodicity, which is unlikely to have evolved in response to biotic adaptive pressures.",2004-09,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,409-425,,5,13,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article",,,,Costa Rica; flower induction; flowering phenology; Mexico; photoperiodic control; rainfall periodicity; tropical deciduous forest; tropical tree phenology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using 2 years of phenology data collected from natural populations near Vila Extrema, Rondonia, and eastern Acre, Brazil, we compared flowering and fruiting in the two habitats and tested for effects of palm height, crown size, and light availability on inflorescence and sex expression. Forest conversion to pasture stimulated greater overall flowering and fruiting in individual Attalea palms.

Crown size and greater light exposure affected flowering and fruiting dynamics in A. phalerata and A. speciosa, respectively, and increased light availability shifted A. speciosa sex expression towards greater female investment, primarily through regulation of sex determination and bud abortion. Removal of tropical forest does not always lead to the downfall of remnant tree populations, and under favorable conditions, such as abandonment of cropland and pasture, higher levels of reproduction can facilitate recovery of future generations. Tree species with flexible sex expression may be particularly resilient in the face of land-use and land-cover change.",2018-10,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,1225-1245,,10,219,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Flowering; Attalea phalerata; Attalea speciosa; Remnant trees; Reproductive biology; Tropical rain forest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, detecting the respective influence of these variables is difficult due to the relatively small range of change that is observed in the tropics. Analysis is further constrained by the limited duration of many phenological datasets. To address these limitations, we developed a predictive ecoinformatic model using multivariate linear regression and slope correlation analysis that can uncover statistically significant biological responses within short, noisy ecological time series. Our approach correlates all possible combinations of climatic and taxonomic variables using a series of random determination trials on shuffled environmental data. Seasonal and annual fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, and sunlight were used to predict the reproductive response of each individual taxon. This predictive model was applied to two seasonally sampled aerial pollen records collected between 1996 and 2006 from two Panamanian forests, Barro Colorado Island and Parque Nacional San Lorenzo. Our results highlight the degree to which pollen output responds to fine-scale variability in climate. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that the pollen output of tropical species is diminished with prolonged periods of heavy rainfall and that pollen output is sensitive to small, seasonal increases in temperature. Our ecoinformatic approach can be expanded to other observational phenological datasets to better understand how communities will respond to climate change and our results demonstrate the ability of aerial pollen data to track long-term changes in flowering phenology.",2017-09,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,54-63,,,41,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article",,,,Climate; Ecoinformatics; Ecology; Palynology; Phenology; Pollen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth periodicity of individual trees is proposed here to reflect primarily an endogenous rhythm of vegetative growth resulting from periodic leaf replacement. This endogenous periodicity determines the species-specific timing of flowering and can be entrained secondarily to seasonal changes in water stress. These assumptions have been incorporated into a simple computer model which illustrates the effects of various degrees of seasonal drought on tree growth periodicity. A range of periodic growth patterns observed in individual trees and tree communities subject to increasing seasonal drought can be simulated by the model suggesting that causal interactions similar to those operating in the model are sufficient to determine growth periodicity in tropical trees and forests.",1992-09,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,385-395,,3,24,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,PHENOLOGY; DROUGHT EFFECT; HYDROPERIODICITY; MODEL; PERIODICITY; SIMULATION; TROPICAL FORESTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although plant species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology are rare, they provide predictable food resources and therefore may play a pivotal role in animal community structure and diversity. I experimentally planted a supplemental patch of a shrub species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology, Hamelia patens Jacq., into coffee agroforests to evaluate the contribution of this unique phenology to the structure and diversity of the flower-visiting community. After accounting for the higher abundance of captured animals in the coffee agroforests with the supplemental floral resources, species richness was 21% higher overall in the flower-visiting community in these agroforests compared to control agroforests. Coffee agroforests with the steady-state supplemental floral patch also had 31% more butterfly species, 29% more hummingbird species, 65% more wasps and 85% more bees than control coffee agroforests. The experimental treatment, together with elevation, explained 57% of the variation in community structure of the flower-visiting community. The identification of plant species that can support a high number of animal species, including important ecosystem service providers, is becoming increasingly important for restoration and conservation applications.

In this study, 3793 trees from 104 species in Kibale National Park, Uganda were monitored. The trees were selected from two sites (Kanyawara and Ngogo) separated by 10 km. Trees were monitored monthly to document community-wide and population-level fruiting and flowering patterns for a maximum of 76 mo. Analysis of two sites over a number of years permitted examination of generalities of patterns found on smaller spatial and temporal scales. Spectral analysis indicated that community-level flowering and fruiting at Kanyawara exhibited regular annual peaks, although the flowering peaks were of shorter duration. At Ngogo, community-level flowering also displayed regular annual peaks, but fruiting had an irregular pattern with no distinct peaks. The abundance of fruiting trees at Kanyawara was negatively related to the minimum temperature in the previous season (3-7 mo prior). Since fruiting tended to peak when the first wet season of the year was ending and the dry season was beginning, this suggests that the minimum temperature in the previous dry season is important in determining how many individuals fruit. Flowering at Kanyawara peaked immediately after the maximum annual period of high irradiance. Within-species synchronization was evident in the flowering for all species examined at Ngogo and for 64% of those at Kanyawara. Fruiting was synchronous within species for 64% of the species at both sites. Despite this general community-level synchronization, the months of peak fruiting and flowering for some species varied markedly among years. Furthermore, for a number of species the timing of fruiting or flowering events differed between Kanyawara and Ngogo. For some species, trends that were suggested from one year of data were not supported when additional years were considered.

This dataset article is related to the original research article “Reduced reproductive success of the endangered tree brazilwood (Paubrasilia echinata, Leguminosae) in urban ecosystem compared to Atlantic forest remnant: lessons for tropical urban ecology” (Oliveira et al., 2019).

Radial stem growth, in particular, has been associated with the activity of the two secondary meristems, the vascular cambium and, to a lesser degree, the phellogen. In tropical trees vascular cambium activity may occur either virtually year-round, or it may be restricted to a short season. Phellogen and vascular cambium activities may or may not correspond to each other. In subtropical environments, even evergreens may demonstrate seasonal phenology in leaf initiation, flowering and seed set. In the present study, phenological events were analyzed in the evergreen species Aphananthe monoica, Pleuranthodendron lindenii and Psychotria costivenia. A correlation analysis showed that more than half of the variation is shared by phenological event variables (leafing, flowering and fruiting) and radial growth variables (vascular cambium and phellogen activity, and vascular tissue differentiation). Leaf initiation, flowering and vascular cambium activation were the most closely-related simultaneous events during the summer; whereas fruiting, phellogen activity and vascular tissue differentiation were the most closely-related simultaneous events during the summer and fall.

Most sustainable forest management practices avoid clear-cuts and apply selective logging systems focused on a few commercial species. We applied a simulation model to estimate the impact of such selective logging scenarios on the genetic diversity and demography of four tropical tree species from French Guiana. The simulations used data on genetic and demographic composition, growth, phenology and pollen and seed dispersal obtained for Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra, Symphonia globulifera and Vouacapoua americana at the experimental site in Paracou. Whereas Symphonia globulifera serves as a model for a species with low logging pressure, the other three species represent the most exploited tree species in French Guiana. In simulations with moderate logging, typical for French Guiana, with large cutting diameter (> 60 cm diameter) and long cutting cycles (65 years), the two species V. americana and Sextonia rubra were not able to recover their initial stock at the end of the rotation period, with a large decrease in the number of individuals and in basal area. Under a more intensive logging system (cutting diameter > 45 cm diameter, cutting cycles of 30 years) that is common practice in the Brazilian Amazon, only Symphonia globulifera showed no negative impact. Generally, the differences between the genetic parameters in the control scenarios without logging and the logging scenarios were surprisingly small. The main reasons for this were the overlapping of generations and the effective dispersal ability of gene vectors in all species, which guarantee relative homogeneity of the genetic structure in different age classes. Nevertheless, decreasing the population size by logging reduced the number of genotypes and caused higher genetic distances between the original population and the population at the end of the logging cycles. Sensitivity analysis showed that genetic changes in the logging scenarios were principally determined by the growth, densities and cutting diameter of each species, and only to a very small extent by the reproductive system including factors such as pollen and seed dispersal and flowering phenology.

Flowering patterns have been analysed against the predictions of three overlapping hypotheses based on climatic, biotic and phylogenetic explanations. No one hypothesis is supported to the exclusion of the others. Patterns of flowering in the Wet Tropics show marked seasonal increases and decreases, except in the northern lowlands. In general this seasonality correlates with rainfall and temperature and is exacerbated by increasing latitude and altitude. There is little or no statistical evidence for the over-dispersion of flowering times that would indicate a competition-avoidance mechanism: flowering within taxa or morphological groups tends to be clumped (and if not, is random). That clumping of flowering within taxa does not coincide with a single season provides support for a mass action hypothesis based on the minimization of generalist predation and/or the avoidance of flower predation. Timing of flowering did show some consistency among species within genera and within families, but there was little consistency at higher taxonomic levels. Clear separation of the biotic and phylogenetic hypotheses requires greater knowledge of pollination ecology and phylogeny of this large and diverse flora.

We conducted monthly observations during five years through a community-based monitoring program in two conservation areas within the Zicuiran-Infiernillo Biosphere Reserve (West Mexico) to assess the flowering and fruiting phenology of 149 marked trees (7-20 trees per species). For each species we described the phenophase intensity, duration, seasonality, synchrony and frequency. We related the intensity of reproductive phenology to climatic variables (photoperiod, precipitation and temperature). We identified three main phenological strategies of SDTF species that differ in timing and climatic triggers: (1) flowering and fruiting exclusively in the rainy season; (2) flowering in the rainy season and fruiting in the dry season; and (3) flowering and fruiting exclusively in the dry season. For each phenological strategy we make recommendations of optimal collecting seeds schedules. The community-based monitoring program, which involves the participation of local social actors, guaranteed the success of long-term phenological monitoring. Our study provides valuable information on both the inter-annual and inter-specific variation of the phenological patterns of tree species of forestry interest, and demonstrates that qualitative descriptions of population-level phenological attributes is an essential input to develop adaptive management programs.

The phenology of tropical gynodioecious figs is important to vertebrates relying on fig fruit as a resource, and to understanding the evolution of gynodioecy in Ficus. 2 Gynodioecious fig species have hermaphrodite trees with closed, urn-shaped inflorescences bearing male and female flowers, and female trees with inflorescences bearing female flowers. Pollinators entering receptive inflorescences on hermaphrodite trees pollinate, lay eggs in female flowers, and die; weeks later, offspring emerge, mate and carry pollen from hermaphrodite trees to other trees. Wasps entering inflorescences on female trees pollinate female flowers but cannot lay eggs, and die without leaving offspring. Hermaphrodite ('male') trees produce pollen and wasps, and no seeds; female trees produce only seeds. 3 During 1991 and 1992, I observed the phenology of two gynodioecious fig tree species, Ficus exasperata and F. hispida, in a dry and a wet site in Coorg District, south India. 4 Ficus exasperata trees displayed a synchronous phenology very similar to that predicted by one hypothesis relating the evolution of gynodioecy to phenology. Female trees of F. exasperata produced seeds synchronously during the monsoon season and `male' trees produced pollinator wasps and pollen synchronously during the peak period of female receptivity. Crop production occurred more frequently in the dry than in the wet site. Female trees bore mature fruit for longer periods than `male' trees. 5 In contrast, several phenological traits of F. hispida departed strongly from prediction. This species displayed an asynchronous phenology at the population level. Receptivity and wasp or seed production in F. hispida occurred year-round, female trees produced more crops than `male' trees, and there was considerable overlap in timing of `male' and female inflorescence production. Durations of phenological phases were longer on female than on `male' trees at the wet site. 6 An asynchronous phenology appears to be more advantageous in aseasonal than in seasonal environments. If the two phenological types observed in this study are found to be widespread, then the possibility that functional dioecy in Ficus evolved via more than one pathway must be considered.",1996-10,02/03/2025 20:24,02/03/2025 20:24,,667-680,,5,84,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL Publisher: BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD Type: Article",,,,flowering; fruiting; dioecy; India; tropics; pollination; evolution; Ficus; Hymenoptera; Moraceae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S9DZAZIM,journalArticle,2014,"Ramirez, Fernando; Davenport, Thomas Lee; Fischer, Gerhard; Augusto Pinzon, Julio Cesar; Ulrichs, Christian",Mango trees have no distinct phenology: The case. of mangoes in the tropics,SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE,,0304-4238,10.1016/j.scienta.2014.01.040,,"We propose a convenient, easily observable set of landmark developmental stages during vegetative and flowering flushes and fruiting events to characterize the changes through which individual growing mango shoots pass in the tropics and subtropics. Individual non-growingstems are in the Resting stage (R), when the apical bud (following a previous vegetative growth event) or lateral buds (following a previous flowering event) are dormant. A flush event is one in which the resting buds on many stems in a section of tree canopy initiate growth (asynchronous flush) or when the entire canopy initiates bud growth at once (synchronous flush). The stages describing vegetative shoot growth are: Vegetative Bud Emergence and Development stage, Elongating Green Leaf stage, Limp Red Leaf stage (LRL), Immature Green Leaf stage, and Mature Green Leaf stage. Reproductive growth stages in purely flowering, or generative, shoots are: Floral Bud Initiation, Emergence and Development stage, Early Panicle Elongation stage, Mid-size Panicle Early Anthesis stage, and Full-size Panicle Maximum Anthesis stage. Fruiting stages are: Emergent Fruit stage, Small-size Green Fruit stage, Mid-size Green Fruit stage, Near Full-size Immature Fruit stage, and the Full-size Mature Fruit stage. Mixed shoots, bearing both leaves and lateral inflorescences at each node, exhibit characteristics of both vegetative and flowering shoots. Landmark stages for Tommy Atkins and Keitt, two cultivars commercially growing in the Americas, were observed in tropical orchards near the village of La Mesa, Colombia. Tommy Atkins leaves had a more intense red coloration during the LRL than did `Keite. More pedicels were found in `Tommy Atkins' than in `Keitt' during panicle development. Young fruits of `Tommy Atkins' developed their distinctive, dark red coloration, whereas `Keitt' fruit developed less intense reddish coloration once they were mature. Aside from these minor phenotypic differences in distinctive shoot and stem developmental stages, attempts to ascribe a distinct phenological pattern of mango tree growth and development are impractical. Each stem terminal or groups of stem terminals borne on scaffolding branches act as independent structures influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature, water relations, and nutrition coupled with their physiological age resulting in widely variable tree responses even in similar environments.
